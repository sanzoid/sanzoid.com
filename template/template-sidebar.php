		<h1>About Me!</h1>
		<p>My name is Sandy Ho.</p>
		<p>I thought I had life figured out, but then life happened.</p>

		<p>My purpose is not to code for a living, to live an ordinary life, to own a house and start a family... it is to CREATE with code.</p>

		<p>What's the point of money when you have too much of it?</p>

		<h1>Purpose of this website</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Showcase what I've done in life</li>
			<li>Put in-class notes for my Psychology classes</li>
			<li>Publicly record my thoughts and opinions - they sound good in my head, but most of the time when it comes out in actual words, it sounds terrible </li>
			<li>Organize my life in terms of my accomplishments, current projects, and goals</li>
			<li>To remind myself that I can't die yet</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Things I definitely have to do before I die</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Go to SDCC</li>
			<li>Watch all of the Marvel Cinema Universe films</li>
		</ul>
