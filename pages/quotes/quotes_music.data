There are some in this world who have strength on their own<br>Never broken or in need of repair<br>But there are some born to shine who can't do it alone<br>So protect them and take special care.
Don't Forget Me (Smash)
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?<br>You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known<br>Remember all the sadness and frustration<br>And let it go.
Iridescent (Linkin Park)
I tried so hard<br>And got so far<br>But in the end<br>It doesn't even matter.
In The End (Linkin Park)
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around<br>Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
Waving Through A Window (Dear Evan Hansen)
There's only us, there's only this<br>Forget regret or life is yours to miss<br>No other road, no other way<br>No day but today.
No Day But Today (Rent)
There's spit on my face<br>The hot breath of the human race<br>And I know, I know, I'm supposed to integrate<br>But hows about instead I inch away?
Get Out The Way (Mother Mother)
