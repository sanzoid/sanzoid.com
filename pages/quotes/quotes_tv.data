There is, unquestionably, a certain social utility to being polite, to maintaining an awareness of other people's sensitivities, to exhibiting all the traits that might commonly be grouped under the heading 'nice'. I am not a nice man. It is important that you understand that, it is going to save you a great deal of time and effort. There is not a warmer, kinder me waiting to be coaxed out into the light. I am acerbic. I can be cruel. It is who I am, right to the bottom. I'm neither proud of this nor ashamed of it. It simply is. And, in my work, my nature has been an advantage far more often than it's been a hindrance. I'm not gonna change."<br>"You have. You're not the same person I met a year and a half ago."<br>"Good to you? Yeah. For the most part. I consider you to be... exceptional. So I make an exceptional effort to accommodate you. But you must accept that, for as long as you choose to be in my life, there will occasionally be fallout from my behavior. That must be a part of our understanding."<br>"No one can accept something like that forever."<br>"To thine own self, Watson.
Sherlock and Joan (Elementary)
If you love someone, you tell them. Even if you're scared that it's not the right thing. Even if you're scared that it'll cause problems. Even if you're scared that it will burn your life to the ground, you say it, and you say it loud and you go from there.
Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)
I'm not saying it's easy to ignore the way people look at you. But I hope you can find some solace in the fact that when I look at you... <br><br>That's Polaris, the north star. That's how sailors used to find their way home. When I look at you, that's what I see. I see my way home

Gareth (Galavant)
It doesn't really bother me. I don't need a congressional honor. I don't need Agent Thompson's approval, or the President's. I know my value. Anyone else's opinion doesn't matter.

Michael Scott (The Office)
Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues and then inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you're a winner. If i didn't, I don't. But I just met you all, life is long, opinions change. Winners, prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong.
Robert California (The Office)
