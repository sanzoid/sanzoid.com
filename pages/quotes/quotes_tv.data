It's a useful mental exercise. Through the years, many thinkers have been fascinated by it. But I don't enjoy playing... Because it was a game that was born during a brutal age when life counted for little. Everyone believed that some people were worth more than others. Kings. Pawns. I don't think that anyone is worth more than anyone else... Chess is just a game. Real people are not pieces. You can't assign more value to some of them and not others. Not to me. Not to anyone. People are not a thing that you can sacrifice. The lesson is, if anyone who looks on to the world as if it is a game of chess, deserves to lose.
Harold Finch
Oh, I've learned to deal with pain. I'm not quite sure who I'd be without it. Pain tethers me to the world.
Harold Finch
Well, I could make an effort to be liked, but I'd rather be hated than inconvenienced.
Wilhelmina Slater (Ugly Betty)
Somehow you got it in your head that this is your story, but you gotta let that go. You're starting to come up with a whole new story for yourself. You are who you are. And the sooner you're okay with that, the sooner you see what I see, the happier you're going to be.
Hilda Suarez (Ugly Betty)
When I was the CEO, I found that it was more about choosing the one wrong answer that you can live with.

To exist is to survive unfair choices.
The OA
Every day we change the world, but to change the world in a way that means anything, that takes more time than most people have. 
Elliot Alderson (Mr. Robot)
Sometimes, we just need a reason when a situation is completely unreasonable. Do you know why I always blame myself in situations like this? Because at least it's an answer. 
Oliver Queen (Arrow)
Who cares that the kids your age don't get you. That means that you're more interesting than them. That means you're going to be hanging around kids that are more interesting. You're gonna have a more interesting life. 
Gloria (Modern Family)
I guess the thing is that if I made a mistake, then at least it was mine, you know? 
Felicity
And I wanted to tell you because well, I don't kow why I wanted to tell you. Because you provoke me. You know, you make me think about things that I never think about. Without even saying anything, just by the way you look at me. 
Ben (Felicity)
Is it possible to be just friends with someone I have these immoderate feelings for, or am I doomed forever to be in love and ultimately significantly hurt? 
Felicity 
Dear Felicity, <br>Here it goes. I've watched you for four years, always wondered what you were like, what was going on in your mind when you were so quiet, just thinking, drawing in your notebook. I should have just asked you, but I never asked you. So now, four years later, I don't even know you, but I admire you. Well, this makes me sound crazy, but I'm okay with that. So take care of yourself. <br>Love, <br>Ben. <br>PS, I would have said keep in touch, but unfortunately we never were in touch. 
Ben (Felicity)
How often do you learn so much so quickly? It's invigorating.
Sherlock Holmes (Elementary)
The rise of social media has created a generation of narcissists eager to offer up their private images for public consumption.
Sherlock Holmes (Elementary)
How'd you do all of that?"<br>"I was bitten by a radioactive detective.
Sherlock Holmes (Elementary)
Personally, I abhor the typical.

What is existence but the absorption of and reaction to the data that the universe presents? You can either grasp these truths, or you can misinterpret them to your constant and considerable agitation.
Sherlock Holmes (Elementary)
The great love of my life is a homocidal maniac. No one's perfect.
Sherlock Holmes (Elementary)

I abhor the dull routine of existence.
Sherlock Holmes (Elementary)
Paranoia is the byproduct of being consistently right. You should aspire to it.
Sherlock Holmes (Elementary)
There is, unquestionably, a certain social utility to being polite, to maintaining an awareness of other people's sensitivities, to exhibiting all the traits that might commonly be grouped under the heading 'nice'. I am not a nice man. It is important that you understand that, it is going to save you a great deal of time and effort. There is not a warmer, kinder me waiting to be coaxed out into the light. I am acerbic. I can be cruel. It is who I am, right to the bottom. I'm neither proud of this nor ashamed of it. It simply is. And, in my work, my nature has been an advantage far more often than it's been a hindrance. I'm not gonna change."<br>"You have. You're not the same person I met a year and a half ago."<br>"Good to you? Yeah. For the most part. I consider you to be... exceptional. So I make an exceptional effort to accommodate you. But you must accept that, for as long as you choose to be in my life, there will occasionally be fallout from my behavior. That must be a part of our understanding."<br>"No one can accept something like that forever."<br>"To thine own self, Watson.
Sherlock and Joan (Elementary)
If you love someone, you tell them. Even if you're scared that it's not the right thing. Even if you're scared that it'll cause problems. Even if you're scared that it will burn your life to the ground, you say it, and you say it loud and you go from there.
Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)
I'm not saying it's easy to ignore the way people look at you. But I hope you can find some solace in the fact that when I look at you... <br><br>That's Polaris, the north star. That's how sailors used to find their way home. When I look at you, that's what I see. I see my way home
Raymond Reddington (The Blacklist)
When you find that one person who connects you to the world, you become someone different, someone better. When that person is taken from you, what do you become then?

All of humankind has one thing in common: The Sandwich. I believe that all anyone really wants in this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich.
Liz Lemon
Reading's for morons who can't understand pictures!
Gareth (Galavant)
It doesn't really bother me. I don't need a congressional honor. I don't need Agent Thompson's approval, or the President's. I know my value. Anyone else's opinion doesn't matter.

There's only two kinds of straight people in this world: the ones that hate you to your face and the ones that hate you behind your back.

The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle.
Michael Scott's mom (The Office)
Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
Michael Scott (The Office)
Too many words coming at me from too many different sentences.
Michael Scott (The Office)
Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues and then inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you're a winner. If i didn't, I don't. But I just met you all, life is long, opinions change. Winners, prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong.
Robert California (The Office)
Don't ask 'Are you?' because it's never a question. Just say 'I know.'

The existence of life is a highly overrated phenomenon.
Dr. Manhattan (Watchmen)
You're a kid and your whole life's ahead of you and you have these notions about what life is, and then... what it could be, but eventually you have to let all that go.
Quentin Coldwater (The Magicians)
I know people think I'm crazy. It's just more fun believing even when no one else does.
Jessica Jones
You have no idea how this feels."<br>"That's true, but I can see it in your face.
Lie To Me
There was a brutal murder there."<br>"So statistically, another murder is unlikely.
Jessica Huang (Fresh Off The Boat)
You can't do every silly thing you want to in life. You have to make your choices, you have to try to be happy with them.
