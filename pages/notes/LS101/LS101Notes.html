<p>Critical Legal Studies lens - pull back assumptions and look at how it modifies/shapes different aspects in our lives. How society/social change impacts the law. Law shapes morality, but society propel laws to change. <span class="ex">Mother-child in prisons.  The bond. Not all women have maternal instinct, want to mother. </span></p>

<h1>Introduction to Legal Studies</h1>

<p>Law is pervasive. It permeates all form sof social interaction and represents a complex and expensive system of social control.</p>
<p><span class="key">Cricical Legal Studies (CLS)</span> is law in action as opposed to law in the books. Law in practice has unforeseen consequences. Law in theory is all good, but in practice... that's another story.</p>

<h2>What is the law?</h2>
<p>It's ambiguous, contradictory. Hard to define. Interpreted subjectively by different people. Activists, judges, lawyers, and victims Everyone has a different conceptualiztion. No true consensus.</p>

<ul>The difference perspectives: 
	<li><span class="key">Jurist Perspective</span> - Law provides predicitability and consistency. Uniformity of rules. Make decisions based on past decisions. Precedence. Courts are backed by authority and power of the state. Logic and decision-making to ensure predictability. Pragmatic and temporal - based on what's happening in the world.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Sociological Perspective</span> (Weberian) - Construct of order. Law creates order. Presence of an instrument of coercive power. Custom vs. convention. Custom - over a long period of time, unquestioned. Convention - also over a long period of time, unquestioned, but out of obligation.
	<ol>Law is these three things: 
		<li>Pressure for individual to comply where compliance comes from external threat. You have to comply whether you like it or not.</li>
		<li>External threates involve coercive force. <span class="ex">Threat of jail</span></li>
		<li>Coercive threats used to enforce the law by political authority.<span class="ex">Police</span></li>
	</ol>
	Rules of law are a guide for action. Without interpretation and enforcement, law is meaningless. Law conceptualized as a method and part of a social process. Process that enforces from social interaction between groups. More power and resources -> control how laws are made and enforced. <span class="ex">Mandatory Minimums - if you're arrested and guilty, you must be given a minimum sentence, no argument. Marginalized women in relationship with drug dealers. The benefit: you can't get out of the punishment. Disadvantage: woman may be under duress - pimp could be the father of her child, she gets swept up into the system without choice.</span>
	</li>
	<li><span class="key">Law and Society Perspective</span> (1970s+) - Multidisciplinary. Governmental social control. State wants to regulate and constrict us. Manage offender for compliance. Law steps in if all institutions have failed. Institutions such as education, workplace, family, church, child welfare. <span class="ex">Mother incarcerated means family, doctors, church, child welfare failed.</span>
	Law is a formal sysem - explicit rules that govern our behaviour.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is Law and Society?</h2>

<ol>4 Key assumptions: 
	<li>Legal system doesn't operate autonomously - it impacts us and we impact it.</li>
	<li>Law and legal decisions impacts aspects of society. There is interplay with politics, culture, religion, and economics. Logic and decision making. </li>
	<li>Law may be changed by societal change. Society change -> Law change.</li>
	<li>Law is reflective of its respective society (Traditional vs. complex)</li>
</ol>

<ul>Key Questions: 
	<li>How effective is law in controlling human and organizational behaviour?</li>
	<li>What is the impact of new laws on other social institutions? <span class="ex">How the mother-child program in prisons impacts how child welfare agencies work.</span></li>
	<li>Are non-legal procedures more or less effective than legal procedures to settle disputes?</li>
	<li>To what extent is the law an instrument of societal change? Law creates change, but is also changed by society.<span class="ex">Abortion laws - they restrict abortions to hospitals - restricts the access to resources. What if you can't get to a hospital? What if the wait list is too long? Want to revamp to grant unquestioned access.</span></li>
	<li>In which way/degree is the legal system characterized by inequality?</li>
	<li>To what degree does the law reproduce inequality and injustice?<span class="ex">No money -> can't hire a lawyer. Child custody -> favours maternal figure.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>How do we study law and society?</h2>

<p><span class="key">Legal Realism</span> (Early to mid 1900s) - Up until this point, it was assumed that the law just worked. It was unquestioned. But laws don't always work in practice. They examined decisions of appellant judges and juries to see if it worked. Looked at how the law truly works, not how it ought to work. <span class="ex">There are certain rules that people don't take seriously such as Jaywalking and traffic violations.</span></p>

<p><span class="key">Critical Legal Studies</span> (1970s) - Look at how law serves certain interests and inequalities. </p>
<ul>Assumptions: 
	<li>Law is politics <span class="ex">Conservative party introduced a lot of conservative laws.</span></li>
	<li>Law is indeterminate - it's ambigious and contradictory</li>
	<li>Law is ideological - supported by system of values and beliefs that enforce the status quo.</li>
	<li>Legal education enhances student passivity and reproduces inequality. In law school, you only study law (what's written), but not its effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem: taken up by white males. Neglected by race and gender.</p>
<p><span class="key">Critical Race Theory## and ##Feminist Legal Theory</span> - society is racist and sexist. Look at how law reproduces this and how law can change. Liberal feminists would say we can definitely change. Radical feminists would say that we're in far too deep and can't change anything.</p>

<h1>Defining Types of Law</h1>

<h2>What is Law?</h2>
<ul>Law is norms or rules that
	<li>Have been estabilished by a political body</li>
	<li>Are enforced by threats of punishment or coercion</li>
	<li>Are enforced by agencies who are authorized to do so</li>
</ul>
<p>Law is intended to bed our interests and of the state's. This is where legitimacy comes from (government).</p>
<p>Laws are written/codified, public, formal system of social control.</p>
<p>They're symbolic of power because state has means (via coercion) to pass and enforce laws.</p>

<ul>Types of law: 
	<li>Substantive vs. Procedural
	<ul>
		<li><span class="key">Substantive Law</span> - Rights, duties, prohibitions set by courts</li>
		<li><span class="key">Procedural Law</span> - Rules about how we do substantive laws- adimistered, enforced, changed, utilized. How laws are upheld/administered</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Public vs. Private
	<ul>
		<li><span class="key">Public law</span> - Relationship between state and individual. <span class="ex">Murder - violae state</span></li>
		<li><span class="key">Private Law</span> - between parties <span class="ex">Neighbours</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Civil vs. Criminal
	<ul>
		<li><span class="key">Civil Law</span> - individual vs. groups. Harms a person, isn't a crime. Person brings suit. Liability. Monetary, declartory, or injunction.</li>
		<li><span class="key">Criminal Law</span> - against society, a violation against the state. State brings the suit. Beyond reasonable doubt. Fine/imprisonment.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
