<p>Critical Legal Studies lens - pull back assumptions and look at how it modifies/shapes different aspects in our lives. How society/social change impacts the law. Law shapes morality, but society propel laws to change. <span class="ex">Mother-child in prisons.  The bond. Not all women have maternal instinct, want to mother. </span></p>

<p class="date">Lecture 2: Jan 8, 2018</p>

<h1>Introduction to Legal Studies</h1>

<p>Law is pervasive. It permeates all form sof social interaction and represents a complex and expensive system of social control.</p>
<p><span class="key">Cricical Legal Studies (CLS)</span> is law in action as opposed to law in the books. Law in practice has unforeseen consequences. Law in theory is all good, but in practice... that's another story.</p>

<h2>What is the law?</h2>
<p>It's ambiguous, contradictory. Hard to define. Interpreted subjectively by different people. Activists, judges, lawyers, and victims Everyone has a different conceptualiztion. No true consensus.</p>

<ul>The difference perspectives: 
	<li><span class="key">Jurist Perspective</span> - Law provides predicitability and consistency. Uniformity of rules. Make decisions based on past decisions. Precedence. Courts are backed by authority and power of the state. Logic and decision-making to ensure predictability. Pragmatic and temporal - based on what's happening in the world.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Sociological Perspective</span> (Weberian) - Construct of order. Law creates order. Presence of an instrument of coercive power. Custom vs. convention. Custom - over a long period of time, unquestioned. Convention - also over a long period of time, unquestioned, but out of obligation.
	<ol>Law is these three things: 
		<li>Pressure for individual to comply where compliance comes from external threat. You have to comply whether you like it or not.</li>
		<li>External threates involve coercive force. <span class="ex">Threat of jail</span></li>
		<li>Coercive threats used to enforce the law by political authority.<span class="ex">Police</span></li>
	</ol>
	Rules of law are a guide for action. Without interpretation and enforcement, law is meaningless. Law conceptualized as a method and part of a social process. Process that enforces from social interaction between groups. More power and resources -> control how laws are made and enforced. <span class="ex">Mandatory Minimums - if you're arrested and guilty, you must be given a minimum sentence, no argument. Marginalized women in relationship with drug dealers. The benefit: you can't get out of the punishment. Disadvantage: woman may be under duress - pimp could be the father of her child, she gets swept up into the system without choice.</span>
	</li>
	<li><span class="key">Law and Society Perspective</span> (1970s+) - Multidisciplinary. Governmental social control. State wants to regulate and constrict us. Manage offender for compliance. Law steps in if all institutions have failed. Institutions such as education, workplace, family, church, child welfare. <span class="ex">Mother incarcerated means family, doctors, church, child welfare failed.</span>
	Law is a formal sysem - explicit rules that govern our behaviour.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is Law and Society?</h2>

<ol>4 Key assumptions: 
	<li>Legal system doesn't operate autonomously - it impacts us and we impact it.</li>
	<li>Law and legal decisions impacts aspects of society. There is interplay with politics, culture, religion, and economics. Logic and decision making. </li>
	<li>Law may be changed by societal change. Society change -> Law change.</li>
	<li>Law is reflective of its respective society (Traditional vs. complex)</li>
</ol>

<ul>Key Questions: 
	<li>How effective is law in controlling human and organizational behaviour?</li>
	<li>What is the impact of new laws on other social institutions? <span class="ex">How the mother-child program in prisons impacts how child welfare agencies work.</span></li>
	<li>Are non-legal procedures more or less effective than legal procedures to settle disputes?</li>
	<li>To what extent is the law an instrument of societal change? Law creates change, but is also changed by society.<span class="ex">Abortion laws - they restrict abortions to hospitals - restricts the access to resources. What if you can't get to a hospital? What if the wait list is too long? Want to revamp to grant unquestioned access.</span></li>
	<li>In which way/degree is the legal system characterized by inequality?</li>
	<li>To what degree does the law reproduce inequality and injustice?<span class="ex">No money -> can't hire a lawyer. Child custody -> favours maternal figure.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>How do we study law and society?</h2>

<p><span class="key">Legal Realism</span> (Early to mid 1900s) - Up until this point, it was assumed that the law just worked. It was unquestioned. But laws don't always work in practice. They examined decisions of appellant judges and juries to see if it worked. Looked at how the law truly works, not how it ought to work. <span class="ex">There are certain rules that people don't take seriously such as Jaywalking and traffic violations.</span></p>

<p><span class="key">Critical Legal Studies</span> (1970s) - Look at how law serves certain interests and inequalities. </p>
<ul>Assumptions: 
	<li>Law is politics <span class="ex">Conservative party introduced a lot of conservative laws.</span></li>
	<li>Law is indeterminate - it's ambigious and contradictory</li>
	<li>Law is ideological - supported by system of values and beliefs that enforce the status quo.</li>
	<li>Legal education enhances student passivity and reproduces inequality. In law school, you only study law (what's written), but not its effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem: taken up by white males. Neglected by race and gender.</p>
<p><span class="key">Critical Race Theory## and ##Feminist Legal Theory</span> - society is racist and sexist. Look at how law reproduces this and how law can change. Liberal feminists would say we can definitely change. Radical feminists would say that we're in far too deep and can't change anything.</p>

<h1>Defining Types of Law</h1>

<h2>What is Law?</h2>
<ul>Law is norms or rules that
	<li>Have been estabilished by a political body</li>
	<li>Are enforced by threats of punishment or coercion</li>
	<li>Are enforced by agencies who are authorized to do so</li>
</ul>
<p>Law is intended to bed our interests and of the state's. This is where legitimacy comes from (government).</p>
<p>Laws are written/codified, public, formal system of social control.</p>
<p>They're symbolic of power because state has means (via coercion) to pass and enforce laws.</p>

<ul>Types of law: 
	<li>Substantive vs. Procedural
	<ul>
		<li><span class="key">Substantive Law</span> - Rights, duties, prohibitions set by courts</li>
		<li><span class="key">Procedural Law</span> - Rules about how we do substantive laws- adimistered, enforced, changed, utilized. How laws are upheld/administered</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Public vs. Private
	<ul>
		<li><span class="key">Public law</span> - Relationship between state and individual. <span class="ex">Murder - violae state</span></li>
		<li><span class="key">Private Law</span> - between parties <span class="ex">Neighbours</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Civil vs. Criminal
	<ul>
		<li><span class="key">Civil Law</span> - individual vs. groups. Harms a person, isn't a crime. Person brings suit. Liability. Monetary, declartory, or injunction.</li>
		<li><span class="key">Criminal Law</span> - against society, a violation against the state. State brings the suit. Beyond reasonable doubt. Fine/imprisonment.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
	
<p class="date">Lecture 3: Jan 10, 2018</p>

<p>when a civil suit follows a criminal action. In certain cases, a civil, we can have a criminal action and civil action that follows up. Advantages and disadvantages of doing that. Financial compensation from civil suit. Certain instances where it's better to have a civil case.</p>

<h1>Traditional vs. Complex Societies.</h1>
<p>Legal systems have evolved and changed because we have evolved and changed. They relied on convention and custom. Early 1100s - King henry - Western - develop a system that's centralized where there's a legal system that codified its laws according to what the state deems legal and illegal. Other forms of social control in traditional societies - family, religion. Lots of emphasis on informal social controls liek family, religion, custom. <span class="ex">Organized cream - mafia - traditonalized - own set of rules and customs - above the law in their own sense. </span></p>
<p>We are more complex. Migratoin patterns, globalizations, not homogenous but heterogenous, way more interactions, we have different values (different groups, customs, culture, religions), beautcratization (formalized systems of governments), we have more people. We need more governance.</p>

<h1>Part 3: Functions of the law</h1>
<p></p>

<h2>1. Maintain social control and social order</h2>
<p>Maintain function of law - to r@@egulate@@ behaviour and @@maintain@@ an @@orderly@@ society. A blueprint for action to guide our behaviour. It outlines @@expected behaviour@@ implicitly rooted in power, authority and sanctions. It has to be @@visible and recognizable@@. Visible and recognizable repressive function to aid in social control.  Should be able to know what the laws are and have to be clear and transparent so we know what's right and wrong, and have to see examples of punishment. Therefore @@Coercive@@ function that includes a prescription of punishments for violations.</p>

<p>Trying to punish an drepress wrongful acts as suggested by conflict theory. Certain societies rely on repression more than others <span class="ex">NA: death penalty. Dictatorships, heavy military presence - use brute force to invoke the law.</span>The law functions to make behaviour @@predictable@@ through defining roles, rights, and responsibilities.. The law has to have an element of predictability - makes it easy for the everyday person to know what' sright and wrong - helps complex societies to keep running and functioning. The legal is not the only institution that's involved in implementing social controls. The legal system is part of a @@spectrum@@.  </p>

<h2>2. Laws help in dispute resolution. </h2>
<p>To extent that there is @@respect for the law@@, the law offers a blueprint for dispute settlement via courts and other conflict resolution systems. Peaceful resolution in place of ware or vengeance. <span class="ex">#BlackLivesMatter - argument: certain groups are targeted by the police, racialized.</span>Within marginalized groups, the feeling is that the police is not there to protect them, but to undermine their communities, so there's not much respect for the law. Conflict however can result when members of society @@disagree on fundamental values@@. Trying to move away from vengeance, etc. This is explained by the pluralistic model of social order to explain disputes as result of @@heterogeneity@@. </p>
<p>Currently, we have laws but people still violate them. </p>

<h1>3. Law as instrument of social change</h1>
<p>Law as @@mechanism to engage social change@@ in complex societies. Evident in legislative initiatives that are justified by out political leaders. Laws have an @@innovative and redistributive function@@ because they can mobilize change in society and redistribute power, privileges and resources. <span class="ex">Legalization of gay marriage - values on sexual orientation, what defines a relationship. Moving away from religious tenaments. </span></p>

<h1>4. Laws uphold rights and define duties. </h1>
<p>This is via @@coercive power@@ of the state, laws @@define duties@@/obligations to various roles. Laws also @@define rights@@ and previleges, legitimizing a [person's claim to these rights. <span class="ex">A parent has rights and responsibilities. Parent is obligated to provide food and shelter to children and right to chose names, schools, relligion, etc. </span></p>

<h1>5. Laws communicated moral standards - the ideological function</h1>
<p>##Legal moralism##. Used to preserve the moral order of society. Laws legitimate certain conduct or condemn other behaviours. Condemns or condones. Represent collective will of the people, therefore represents predominate social and moral values (law has high degree of moral authority). Educational, socialization, legitimationn function to communicate societies' moral values. </p>

<p>The legalization of marijuana as a case in point. Respect for law = condemnation of behaviours that violate the law. Good vs. bad and moral influence. Marijuana is perceived as less harmful, but others say it's a gateway. The respect for law means there's a condemnation of the law. IT is argued that removing the criminal prohibition of marijuana, the government is condoning its usage. Educatoinal component - illegal - don't smoke, it's bad. Is government condoning marijuana use with the legalization of marijuana? It would regulate it, help with high cost of incarceration. Sinking resources in evaluating high-ness. We could be making marijuana cleaner. </p>

<h1>Dysfunction of the law</h1>
<p>Follows our critical legal studies perspective. The law is utilized to justify and protect the status quo., prevent reforms and social change, and entrench inequities within society. The law is discriminatory and promote injustice and inequality between rich and poor. It's a weapon of oppression against the ppowerless (conflict perspective) to intimidate people into submission. It can be restrictive to people's freedoms and rights which leads to over regulation. If marijuana is overregulated, drug dealers will still sell their stuff - could create the black market again. </p>

<h1>Part 4: Administrative Law</h1>
<p>Goals: Overview branches of government. Demarcate True crimes vs. Regulatory Offences. Discuss adv/disadv of administrative tribunals. </p>

<h2>Branches of government</h2>

<ul>
	<li>##LEgilstative## (federal and provincial) - create statuatory laws</li>
	<li>##Judicial## - courts and hears cases</li>
	<li>##Executive## consists of government departments which are responsible for implemnting laws and social policies. </li>
</ul>

<h2>True crime vs. Regulatory offences</h2>
<p>True crimes are inherently wrong and harmful by the majority (murder, rape, drug use) - offense against society. Regulatory offences control activities that are considered lawful such as business or trade. Regulatory bodies set up to prevent certain activities. They control legitimate aspects of society. Not crimes.</p>

<p>Objective of regulatory offences - to protect the public and societal interests from harm resulting from careless or unscrupulous actions taken by businesses and industry. Regulatory states set minimum standards of conduct and care to safeguard public. Ex: dumping stuf finto lake, noise laws, false advertising. Federal, provincial, municipal scope. Essential to the smooth running of a complex. </p>
<p>Perceptions of regulatory offences - perceived as less serious. Easier to process. Don't need intent. Onus is on the accused to prove that they weren't negligent. Criminal offences have greater penalities and stigma. Moral culpability - not immoral, but it is an offence. The burden of proof for the Crown is less demanding, simply establish actus reus.  Easier for crown to obtain conviction with regulatory offences.</p>
<p>They fall under administrative law and we have administrative tribunals. The role of administrative tribunals: they're quai-criminal statutes with quasi-judicial powers - you can still be punished. Governments provide authority. Tribunals  are expected to have a certain level of expertise in a particular area. Landlord and Tenant Board, HUman Rights Commission, Immigration and Refugee Appeal Board. Disputes arise between citizens and overnment agencies resulting in the development of administrative tribunals. Like court. Rules are more laxed than a criminal/civil proceeding. They act according to ##rule of law##</p>
<p>##The rule of law## - society must be governened accoridng ot sets of clear legal rules. No one is exempt from the law. Want to ensure fairness, demote self-interest, laws are enforced in an equitable fashion. Want to promote fairness and equality. </p>
<ul>Basic elements of the rule of law: 
	<li>Scope of the law - all inidivudlas and groups come under the rule of law</li>
	<li>Character of the law - transparency and legibility of law to alll</li>
	<li>Insitituion of the law - rules to ensure fairness - ex. independent judiciary courts, writtten laws, the right to a fair trial. </li>
</ul>
