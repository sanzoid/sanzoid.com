<p>What is personality psychology? The science of ##individuality##. Variability, noise. Measuring and explaining patterned individual differences in behaviour, subjective experience, and personal functioning. Generalization: each individual is unique. Challenge: how cna we use scitific methods to study indiividuality? Unique patterns - anecdote, rather than science.</p>

<p>We have to study it at a variety of different angles.</p>

<ul>How do we know a person? Three levels of analysis
	<li>Dispositional Traits - what they're like across different situations. Superficial - general. Important, good summary. But not deep. A person as an actor.</li>
	<li>Personal Concerns - values and goals. Motivational, developmental, strategic terms. What they want. What they're like in particular types of situations. What triggers them into action. What engages them? A person as an agent.</li>
	<li>Identity narratives - autobiographers. Telling a story about themselves. Trying to create a coherent meaning out of their lives. Putting a person into a narrative trajectory. Where they were in the past, where they are now, where they're going. A story. How you would describe yourself if you were writing an autobiography. </li>
</ul>
<p>We're going to go through all of these levels. Who we are as actors is establishe dealry in life. Agentic self - emerge in late childhood crystalized in early adulthood. Self as an author - further into adulthood, mature in midlife. Each layer has different intraceptions with developmental periods of life. </p>

<p>Personality evaluation assignment 15% - use personality measures to get a sense of what a person is like. Use it with a partner. Rate acquaintance. Why two different individuals might come to two different conclusions. Midterm - 30% - lecture topics and assigned readings. David funder 7th edition The PErsonality Puzzle. Assigned articles. Personality observation assignment 15% - newer techniques that move away from traditional. Final - 40% - M/C, short answer, latter half, but will have repeat questions. Review sessions. </p>

<p>HEAXCO Personality Traits and Facets. Have a Big 5 model - these psychologicists says there's a missing 6th one -  it captures our moral personality. </p>
<p>Assignment 2 - physical spaces to get insights on people. Dorm rooms, inspect. Same physical space for individuals, but how they use that space can be different. </p>

<p>Why study personality?</p>
<ol>
	<li>People are intrinsically interested in individual differences. We wanna know. Which character are you? Get a sense of our own personalities and personalities of people we know. Fused with interest in pop culture. None are science, just games. Personality excites us. We develop our own theories on personality <span class="ex">Dog people vs. Cat people. But is there any truth to it? Some support for it.</span></li>
	<li>Correcting mistaken or confused ideas about personality differences. <span class="ex">Low self-esteem vs high self-esteem. Self-esteem as a personality dimension. Idea that high self-esteem leads to positive life outcomes. Social problems being tied to low self-esteem. Is there a correlation and if there is, is there a causal relationship? Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold - killed schoolmates and themselves. They recorded their motivations to explain what they were trying to do. It's not low self-esteem, but grandiose high self-esteem. They deserve respect, and the act is oging to get that respect. NPI - Narcissism Personality Inventory - whath they say corresponds to items. An extreme high self-esteem problem. <br>Ego-threatened vs. Praise for your essay. Critical threatening vs. oh you're really great. You have opportunity to aggress.Determine how much of a blast of noise you're going to give the individual. When high narcissism + ego threat -> spike in levels of aggression. Not just high self esteem, just certain situations.<br>Evidence suggests that people's self esteem has been going upward for a long time. What are the consequences of that? Is aggression going to be more common? </span></li>
	<li>Personality differences predict important life outcomes. Does at least as well as other indicators. <span class="ex">Divorce. Corellation between social status, personality measures, and likelihood of divorce. Personality predicts the same as Socioeconomic status. SES predictive element is smaller than personality measures. Neuroticism is reverse scored. </span><span class="ex">Occupational success. Personality traits does at least as good a job than more traditional predictors. Almost as useful as IQ. Better predictor than SES and parental income.</span><span class="ex">Mortality. Personality measures > SES, IQ.</span></li>
</ol>

<h1>Assessing the reliability &amp; Validity of Personality Measures</h1>
<p>Methodologies. How can we assess whether a personality measure is measuring something at all. </p>

<ul>Key criteria: Interdependent. 
	<li>Reliability - is it measuring something real? Or is it capturing unpredictable noise</li>
	<li>Validity - the thing it's measuring is the thing we want it to measure. </li>
</ul>

<p>We need to decompose our measures into true sources of variability.</p>
<p>Measured Value = True Value + Measurement Error</p>
<p>True differences. Measurement error - noise, random fluctuations. There's some combination of the person's true score and error. We want to disentangle how much is true and reliable and how much is random noise.</p>

<ul>Types of error
	<li>Random Measurement Error (noise)</li>
	<li>Systematic Measurement Error (bias) </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<ul>Sources of measurement error 
	<li>Temporary chracteristics - mood, fatigue, distraction. Moment to moment variation. Might contaminate to how we respond to different things. </li>
	<li>Stable characteristics that are different than what you're trying to measure. Some people might have more insight into their personality than others. A measure of agreeableness would be higher with people who have more insight. Self-report requires good self insight. </li>
	<li>Characteristics of the research situation - not just participant's mood, but researcher's mood. </li>
	<li>Characteristics of the scale - if some items are open to different kinds of interpretation. </li>
	<li>Mistakes recording data - when it requires observation - if observation is distracted, checks the wrong box. </li>
</ul>

<ul>Decreasing measurement error 
	<li>Standardize conditions. </li>
	<li>Increase clarity of instructions and scale items. </li>
	<li>Improve training of the observers coding subject responses</li>
	<li>Add safeguards against errors in data coding and entry. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Example of Personality Scale Development</h2>
<p>. The History of MEmasuring Authoritarianism. Individual differences in people's attraction to very strong forces of authority - authoritarianism. What drew people to authority? </p>

<p>Used psychoanalytic theory to explain who was susceptible to joining fascist movements. Harsh coercive authoritarian households. Habitual pattern of having aggression against minorities as a defence mechanism. I can't aggress against powerful people, so you aggress towards minorities, weaker individuals. Submissive to authority, aggressive to minorities. This was their theory. Developed an F (Fascism) Scale to measure authoritatrian personality. </p>
<p>Found that people with high scores on F-scale. All prejudices cohered together. No logical reason why they prejudice against all minorities - only thing common is that they're minority groups. Consistent family backgrounds. More strict + parental discipline. Parents affection was contingent on good behaviour. Only got love when they behaved well. </p>
<p>Research problems. Key problem: unbalanced scale. All items on scale were worded in the same direction. If you agreed, it would indicate you were more authoritarian. It can produce systematic measurement error - some people who tend to agree with things. If you ask, it sounds reasonable, they'll agree. That means the measure is contaminated. Not studying authortarianism, just studying tendency to agree on things. Another problem: theoretical problems. Based on psychoanalytic theory which has been debunked. Clear problems of the theory behind it. </p>
<p>Sidelined because of its problems. But that's a problem because it's not something we should ignore. Being able to measure + assess is important. </p>
<p>Bob Altemeyer at UofManitoba - brought it back. Late 1970s. Tried to update the F-scale.</p>

<p>Right-wing Authoritarianism. Altemeyer's update. Three core dispositions that combine together to draw people to authoritarian. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Authoritarian submission - won't just follow anybody, only people they define as legitimate and established. The true spokesperson. Whoever they see as the legitimate voice of their group, they'll submit.</li>
	<li>Authoritarian aggression - if authorities are saying these are the bad people, threatening people then you will be willing to lash out at these people. Willingless to aggress against parties tha tauthorities label as problems. </li>
	<li>Conventionalism - aversion to practices that are more novel. Neophobia. Not like new kinds of behaviour. </li>
</ul>
<p>We need to measure all three of them. You need items to measure them. 30 Item scale. Included reverse-coded items. <!-- whoops i just lost my ring--> Have to assess if he's measuring something reliable/stable and if it's really autoritarianism. </p>
<p>Different tools to assess reliability. </p>
<p>You need to be able to assess correlation. -1 to +1. Negative association to Positive association. </p>
<p>Is it really measuring something real? ##Test-retest reliability## - Look at stability over time. Should get consistent scores over time. But this assumes that there's no change in participant's score over time. <span class="ex">RWA. keep taking scale. Test-retest reliability - very positive corellation. slightly weaker but still strong. </span></p>
<p>##Inter-rater agreement## - whether two different observers come to the same conclusion. If same, then there must be some underlying truth. <span class="ex">RWA. Do you and your friend agree in rating your authoritarianism? r = 0.45. There is some relationship - not tight, but reliable. There is some true score even when different judges use the same measure.</span></p>
<p>##Internal Consistency## - how much error there is across the items in a scale. How well all of the component items point towards the same conclusion. Look at inter correlation of the separate items. ##Average-item correlation## - take item 1 + 2-6, 2+1,3-6, then average them. ##Split-half corerelations## - subdivide scale into two. Look at correlaiton between scores between those subscales. Problem: how do you choose which goes in what stack. ##Cronbach's alpha## - approximate all of the possible split half reliabilities. Average all of split-half possibilities.</p>

<h1>Personality Judgement - sources of accuracy and error</h1>
<p>Pick up on irregularities and form an impression. Want to understand what other people are like. We should have well-developed recognition of patterns. Want to understand the process of personality judgement. How do we go about assessing personality and how accurate are our judgements?</p>
<span class="ex">Monty Python and the Holy Grail - debate how to judge whether someone is a witch or not. We need cues to diagnose whether someone is a witch. </span>
<p>A lot of the things we want to study and measure are things we cannot directly observe. We need behavioural cues to judge whether that trait is there or not. </p>
<p>True Value -> Cue X -> Judged Value. We want to find the true value, then look at cues, then see what judged value they are. Actual Witch -> x Peaked hat, x long nose, x wart, + lighter than a duck -> Call her a witch. </p>
<p>Cue Validity: Correlation between actual trait level with presence or absence of cue. Some cues are strong correlates of the thing we're trying to measure, others are poor cues. Those cues would not be reliable indicators. <span class="ex">IQ -> . IQ tests, what are the behavioural correlates with whether someone is intelligent or not. .34 - Self-assured expression - of how they interacted with others. -.09 - weight, not correlated. .36 - Standard language - people who followed the rules of language, used grammar. .01 hair length. Want to look at cues and guess how intelligent they are. Had observers look at these people and they formed impression. </span>##Cue utilization## - the correlation of judged trait level with presence or absence of cue. 0.26 self assured expression. -.25 - weight. 0.06 standard language. 0.07 - hair length. See how well people are using the actual evidence of IQ to form an impression of IQ. Valid use of cue: self-assured expression - correlated with actual IQ, correlated with observer's. Valid discounting of cue - it isn't valid, and observers don't use it for judgement. Invalid use of cue - weight - they thought it made them not as smart, even though it's not a valid cue. Invalid discounting of cue - standard language - observers don't use to infer how intelligent someone is. Overall correlation = 0.38 - some cues used appropriately, but also inappropriately. Some positive correlation,b ut not entirely. General model. </p>
<p>Funder's ##realistic accuracy model## (RAM) - accuracy of judgement depends on how well we follow steps. If any steps break down, or if there's error, then it will reduce the accuraccy of the judgement.</p>
<ul>Personality ->
	<li>-> Relevance - relevant cues that indicates that personality trait</li>
	<li>-> Availability - cues need to be available to the observer </li>
	<li>-> Detection - have to be sensitive to the cues. Need to have schemas to recognize that they're relevant.</li>
	<li>-> Utilization - make the correct inferences based on those cues. Recognize valid/invalid cues. Need to come to the right conclusion. </li>
	<li>-> Judgement</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence that we're good at picking up on personality and forming accurate impressions even from minimum information - thin slices of non-verbal behaviour or mere appearance. Recorded a person's non verbal behaviour, removed colour, audio was edited so you could hear tone of voice, but couldn't hear content, length of displays. The correlation of observer's ratings and target's own self ratings (or acquaintance). </p>

<h2>Moderators of accuracy</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Good information</li>
	<li>Good traits</li>
	<li>Good targets</li>
	<li>Good judges</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benchmarks of accuracy</h2>
<p>Different kinds of indices. Subjective indices of accuracy - correlation with self-ratings. Assumption that individuals know themselves. Compare someone else's judgements with self's. Correlation with informant ratings - acquaintances, coworkers, friends, family members. Correlation with expert ratings - clinical interviews - professionals. These are all subjective.</p>
<p>Objective indices of accuracy: relation to concrete behavioural criteria, physiological measures, or performance measures.</p>
<p>Most research uses subjective indices as a benchmark of accuracy.</p>

<h2>Properties of the Information</h2>
<p>Variability in the ##Quality## of the information - relevance to the personality construct. Variability in the ##Quanitity## of information - amount of available/detectable information about the target. </p>
<span class="ex">"Good Information" study - groups of 3 strangers, have them interact. Varied content of lab sessions. Afterwards, they had the 3 individuals judge each others' personalities. 1 condition - minimal info condition - no interactive tasks, just hanging out, just visual information, no verbal interactions. 2nd condition - trivia quiz condition - 50 mins - game-like. 3rd condition - 50 min - free to discuss anything they wished - unstructured interaction. 4th condition - long, unstructured interaction - 3 hour version. 5th condition - "getting to knw" interaction - 50 min - task is to learn about the others. Varied quantity and quality of information. Accuraccy criterion: 1. target's self-ratings, ratings by 2 friends of target, every participant had an interview with clinician. Mark, Joanne, Fatima. The accuracy: lowest to highest: minimal (0.3), trivia, short unstr, long unstr, get to know. Quality trumps quantity. Too structured - limits accuracy. Give them liberty - provides opportunities for personality to express themselves. </span>
<span class="ex">"Good information" example - experimenters collected targets' self-ratings and their friends' ratings of them. Targets participated in 3 interviews that were video-recorded. Cognitive/acffective interview - intervviewre asked target's thoughts/feelings in various situations (how did you feel about that?) 2. Behavioural interview - interviewer asked what target did in various situations and targets were instructed to discuss overt actions 3. Control interview  - interview wiht no specified focus. Took videos of these interviews - took one of the interviews and gave to observer and they rated their personality. Predcitions: correspondence of observers' rating with targets' self-ratings and with friends' ratings should be greater if the observers had watched the cognitive/affective interview condition than in the other ones. Predictions consistent. Highest correlation in cognitive/affective interview. Behavioural info did not produce as strong a correlation. Control was similar to behavioural. </span>

<h2>Properties of the trait</h2>
<p>Traits may differ in the degree to which they express relevant cues that are readily available and correctly interpreted by observers. Some traits may emit more cues that are more readily detectable. Some traits are externally manifested and thusmay be judged as well by others as they are by the self - extraversion. Other traits are internally manifested and thus may be judged better by the self than by others - harder for external observers to use - neuroticism. Observers may be more accurate at judging extraversion over neuroticism. Perceivers may have adaptations to detect and correctly utilize cues of traits that were relevant to reproductive success in our ancestral environment. </p>
<p>Hypothesis from evolutionary psychology. Sociosexuality - individual differences in motivation to pursue short-term mating opportunities (casual sex). Some are choosy and selective, others are less selective. We should be attentive to cues as to how sexually readily available people are. It's important to recognize signs in how readily someone else is to engage in casual sex. If humans have special skills, then after observing a sample of behaviour, then they should become more accurate at judging that trait. To test: heterosexual targets - self ratings - social potency, closeness, stress reacitivity, socio-sexuality. Then the targets were videotaped while being interviewed by an attractive person by the other sex (confederate). Intenrviewed for a potential lunch date. Observers were allowed to view the first minute. Audio was edited out, only saw non-verbal behaviours. Perceivers had to estimate levels of the traits. Looked at correlation between self-ratings and perceiver's ratings. We should see greater accuracy in socio-sexuality judgements. Partial correlations - extracted physical attractiveness of target because more attractive would have more casual sex. 0.4 correlation for siciosexuality opposed to 0.12, 0.15, 0.08 for the rest. </p>

<h2>Properties of the target</h2>
<p>Qualities of the target. Some poeple may be more readable than others. Targets may differ in the extent to which they express relevant personality cues that make information readily available/detectable to observers. Example, psychologically well-adjusted individuals may be more relaxed and disinhibited. </p>
<span class="ex">Groups of strangers - 3 min getting acquanted sessions with every other member of their group. Each interaction participants judged personality traits of others. Participants rated their own personalities and completed measures of psychological adjustment (self-esteem, psychological well-being). Accuraccy measure: correlation of observer's ratings with target's self-ratings. Predictions: well-adjusted targets should be judged more accurately than poorly-adjusted targets. If well-adjusted people are judged more accurately because they're less inhibited in expressing themselves, then the effect of target adjustement on accuracy should be especially strong ofr less readily observable traits. High observability - externally manifesting traits. Low observability - internally manifesting traits. </span>
