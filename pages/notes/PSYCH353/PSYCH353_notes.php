<h1>History of Social Psychology</h1>

<!-- It relates to the history of social psychology because all the psychologists/scientists had troubles breaking into the field of psychology. Sometimes psychologists will invest in a theory to find out that it was never right from the beginning. They ran in circles, chasing their tails, to conclude that they had to go back to the start. -->

<p>Social Cognition between discipline and sub-discipline. </p>

<p>Intervening causes - A causes B, there's always something in between. With Social Cognition, it's the thoughts. A causes thoughts, thoughts causes B. Sticking cognition in the middle. Think of cognition as th eintervening cause between the power of th esituation and the outocmes that we care about. </p>

<h2>Early Social Psychologists</h2>
<p>Social Psychology was always there at the beginning. </p>
<ul>
	<li>$$Triplett - The Fishing reel experiment.$$ Boys. Gave fishing reel. Reel the line on the fishing reel as fast as you can. Manipulated variable - alone or with someone else sitting next to them. Shows a classic effect - they reeled in faster when there were two boys than alone. ##Social Facilitation##. </li>
	<li>$$Floyd Allport - the study of attitudes$$. Student of William James. All psychology was looking at behaviourism - what rewards could influence behaviours. He looked at perpensity towards behaviour. Nowadays, attitudes, thoughts, feelings. </li>
	<li>$$Cooley, Mead, &amp; James - theorizing about the social self-concept.$$ Where do we get a sense of self? How do we decide who we are and what we're like? The ##Looking Glass##. The way we figure out what we're like, is seeing how we're seen by other people. Reflection of how other people see us. </li>
	<li>$$Katz &amp; Braly - the study of stereotyping.$$ Princeton students. Here's a list of ethnic groups. 140 adjectives. Which adjectives go with which group? Turks were mean, evil, mercinary. Blacks were described as stupid, lazy, and superstitious. Every group had strong negative stereotypes. Results have changed over the years. </li>
	<li>$$La Pierre - attitudes links to behaviour.$$ Called up 150 restaurants and said he's going to be traveling with a couple that's in Japan, will you let us stay. Everybody said no. He went to each of them and all but 1 served them. People are stereotyping, but they're not following through. Nowadays, they're not stereotyping, but there are stereotyping. Swithc between attitude and behaviour. Not only what people are thinking/saying, but what they're actually doing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Three Influential Gestalt Psychologists</h2>
<p>Emphasized Perception. Came to North America. Fundamental role in developing Social Psychology. </p>
<ul>
	<li>$$Kurt Lewin$$ - Research Center. </li>
	<li>$$Solomon Asch$$ - Line Judgement studies. Conformity. Understand Nazis. ##Person Perception##. Not perception in objects, but people. How do you perceive another person, how do you decide what they're like? </li>
	<li>$$Fritz Heider$$ - Developed the full expression of Person Perception - ##Attribution Theory##. When you watch somebody, how do you decide what type of person they are? You see people do things - when do you take what they do as reflecting the person they are vs. the situation. <span class="ex">Carla Homocha. How should you think about her? How do you make sense of her? Vicious psychopath or a victim of circumstances?</span> Trying to decide which behaviours tell what this person is really like. </li>
</ul>
	

<h2>The Age of Great Theories and Experiemnts Mid 1940s- Late 1950s</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Asch - ##Conformity##, ##Person Perception##. </li>
	<li>Milgam - Asch's student. ##Obedience##. </li>
	<li>Festinger - Most famous of Kurt Lewin's students. ##Cognitive Dissonance##. Two thoughts that are inconsistent, and that's a strong motivation for behaviour.<br>##Social Comparison## - mathematical theory. Drivne to compare ourselves to other people and that's how we learn about who we are. Everything comes about through comparing ourselves to other people. We don't have a great sense of ourselves until we compare ourselves to other people. </li>
	<li>Heider - ##Balance Theory##. ##Attribution Theory##</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Age of Activism - 1960's </h2>
<p>Huge progress on civil righs. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Stereotyping and Prejudice. School Desegragation. REsearch helped. </li>
	<li>Aggression - Vietnam War. Why is the US fighting this war? What leads to the aggression? <br>##Gun Effect## - presence of guns makes aggression more likely.</li>
	<li>Altruism. ##Bystander Intervention##. </li>
	<li>Interpersonal Relations - ##Attraction##. How do people get along? Romantic relationships. </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Age of Mentalism 1970's</h2>
<p>Social Cognition comes. </p>
<ul>
	<li>The Naive Scientist - How is it that people do things? Why is it they do things? Thought as being the primary cause. People are like naive scientists. People just process information in a very straightforward and ideal way. Lead to ##Attribution Models## devoid of emotions. </li>
	<li>The Cognitive Miser - Maybe not thought, but cognition still motivates. ##Schemas##, ##Heuristics##.</li>
	<li>The Motivated Tactician. ##Accuracy motivation##</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-Doubt and REdefinition </h2>
	
<ul>
	<li>The Activist Tradition - from AGe of Activism</li>
	<li>The Essneitalist Tradition - from Age of Mentalism</li>
	<li>Current Crisis in Social Psychology - people caring more about doing things to make a world a better place vs. focusing on rigorous science. People faking data. Concern of whether people are cheating at getting their results. Scientific Rigor vs. Making a difference in society. Trying to make a difference in society has corrupted science. "There's been fraud all along, but fraud is part of the story." </li>
</ul>
	
	
<h1>A History of Cognitive Psychology</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Wundt's Mental Atomism - Wilhelm Wundt. Thoughts. We understand nothing about our thoughts. He wante dto develop a period table of thoughts. He thought you could divide thoughts to the smallest unit and form thoughts. It was a failure. Colossolly wrong.</li>
	<li>Ebbinghaus' Seminal Work - Start with something simpler. Start with what is real. I know that I remember things and there's other times I forget. Study memory. Discovered that you remember things better if you're given a cue. Recognition > Recall. When you learn soemthing for the second tiem, you learn it much quicker and you're less likely to forget it than the first time. Our memory is bad. Bottom-up.</li>
	<li>The Behaviourist Reaction - Shouldn't be looking at thoughts. Thoughts don't matter. We gotta study behaviour. If it isn't observable, we shouldn't study it. "Show me the atoms." If I can't see it, it doesn't exist. </li>
	<li>The Gestalt Reaction - The problem that Wundt did is that he doesn't understand that thoughts do onot add up the way atoms do. The whole is not equal to the sum of its parts. The wholes are constructed. We take pieces of thoughts and construct them into a new thought and there are gaps. That's why we have optical illusions. Constructing images from only what we have, filling in details. Top-down. </li>
	<li>Bartlett's Reaction - ##Schemas## - larger concept that shapes the way you see the world. </li>
	<li>The Birth of Cognitive Psychology - when behaviourism couldn't explain anumber of things like language acquisition. Thought rewards made kids learn language, but it doesn't work. Kids learn language way too fast for it to be the result of reinforcement. "I runned outside." Nobody rewarding for that. Observational learning - you see somebody else do something, you do that. Classical behavirousm says that you have to be rewarded. We have to insert a thought in there. They said thoughts did not matter, but they didn't. Bobo doll. </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Birth of Cognitive Psychology </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Chomsky's work</li>
	<li>Information processig models of thought </li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
	
<h2>Where the two meet </h2>
<p>Social Psychology vs. Social Cognition. </p>

<ul>
	<li>1972 - Orange Book. first books to come otgether and tlak about attribution theories and try to integreate them with th efindings which werent fitting with the theories. Favour information processing models over motivational models. </li>
	<li>Hamilton's ##illusory correlation## as a possible mechanism for stereotyping. Argued that stereotyping had nothing to do with groups, history of conflict, etc. You can get stereotypes if the group is rare and the behaviours are rare. When two things are rare, you think it's more associated than they are. Doubly noteworthy. Memory error. This is not where stereotypes are coming from. For a while, social psychology was enamored with this. People thought stereotypes about chairs were no different than stereotypes about poeple</li>
	<li>EWork on groups was becoming less important. More focus on individuals. </li>
	<li>Attitudes were being redefined as cognitive associations. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Research Methods - Inferring Causation</h1>
<span class="ex">Watching violence and being violent. </span>
<ul>
	<li>@@Correlation@@ When one variable changes, theh other variable changes. Not causation until we know the direction it goes on. </li>
	<li>@@Time Order@@ Which one comes first? </li>
	<li>@@Eliminate all other possible cuases@@ Experiemnts are designed to do this. Random assignment cannot be about the type of people. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Establishing a Causal Chain Evidence for Psychological Process</h2>
<p>Watching violent media causes violent thoughts. Violent thoughts causes violent behaviour. </p>

<p>Song: Sly &amp; the family stone - everyday people</p>
<!-- This song relates to what we are talking about because in the song, everyone is singling out unique aspects of people, even though people are very similar. It relates to the Solo Status condition. How people don't like each other due to differences as some things such as hair colour/length, colour are more salient than others.  -->

<h1>Making Sense of the World - Why do We Need Concepts?</h1>
<p>Way too much stimuli in the world for us to pay attention to. The snesory information we have to condense and make sense of it. There's only a limited amount tha twe can process at a time. We need concepts: </p>
<ul>
	<li>to have effective communicatoin with other people - we're goinna need a shared way of understanding. Need some sort of language. When we say a word, somebody else has a basic idea of what that word means. Sometimes there's a concept in one language that's not in another language. Help us share the sense of the world with other people.</li>
	<li>grouping similar things together. You can go beyond the information given. <span class="ex">Dogs. You know a bunch of thing from "Dog". You know all of that information even if they vary dramatically.</span> </li>
	<li>allow us to go beyond the information to make inferences and understand what's going on. <span class="ex">Washing clothes. Description. once you know what the concept is, it makes sense.</span>A schema is a way of thinking about the world. <span class="ex">Schema of a dog: what it means to be a dog. </span></li>
	<li>they guide our attention and interpretation - what is it that we should think about in that siituation and how should we think about it? <span class="ex">Wayson card sorting test. If there is a D on one side, there must be a 9 on the other. Are there underage people? D - drinking. N - not drinking. Numbers are age. D, 6, N, 9. </span>It's easy when you have a schema. 90% get i wrong without a schema. LEt us think about a particular situation what to pay attention to and what to interpret. Takes what is abstract and makes it concrete to make it easy. </li>
</ul>
	
<h2>What Concepts Are We thinking About - Activating Concepts</h2>
<p>Salience. What concepts are on your mind? Salients can be conscious or unconscious. We have thousands of concepts.</p>

<ul>
	<li>@@Stimulus features@@ sensing of the information makes that concept salient. So simple that no one's done experiments. The features of our stimulus draws our attention, pulls us to process concepts related to it. </li>
	<li>@@Salience@@ Going on in the head. <span class="ex">Solo Status Studies. How groups of people interact. If there's a group and one person is different from all of them, that person will be more paid attention to. 5 men, 1 woman, more attention is paid attention to the woman. ##Solo Status Condition## is going to make you stand out. Makes you salient.</span><span class="ex">McGuire Studies. Kids in grade school. Grade 5/6 students describe themselves. People described themselves in ways that set themselves apart. Classses with gender equity, the group that's more rare is more likely to mention their gender. </span></li>
	<li>@@Priming@@ You make a concept salient in an experiment - hard to realize that it's happening. You want to make sure that you get people to think abou tthat concept, but you worry that they're only thinking about that concept. Making sure they're thinkin gbaout the concept, but being subtle about it. It's difficult to do. Have to balance between demand characteristic and not influencing at all. <span class="ex">The Donald Study (Srull &amp; Wyer 1979). Words related to aggression and neutral words. Different conditions: 1% aggression-related words, 20%, 80%. Flashed them other words on edges of the screen as they were identifying words in the center of the screen. Then they read a paragraph about <em>Donald</em>. Rate how aggressive Donald is. If you were flashed 80% aggressive-related words, you would rate him more aggressive. 0 vs 20% had no difference. Priming aggression is affecting the way you think about Donald. </span><span class="ex">The Devine Study - 80% related to blacks, Donald is seen more aggressive. Ghetto, rap, etc. Priming blacks, primes aggression. </span></li>
	<li>@@Chronic Accessibility@@ Some poeple have concepts that they think about all the time. <span class="ex">Narcissistic people think about themselves. Defensiveness. How am I being judged?</span> What are the things we always carry with us? Personality psychology. </li>
	<li>@@Goals@@ Things that we adopt until we achieve it. Concepts related to that goal, should be there. Once I've accomplished, I don't need to think about that for a while. <span class="ex">Studying makes things easily accessible. Once you take the test, those things are set aside. The concepts are gone. </span>Things related to the goal are much more salient while we're pursuing the goal. Once the goal is achieved, they fade. They don't need to be salient.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Nature of Concepts</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
	<li>@@The Classical View@@ WRONG. You can define things with necessary and sufficient categories. This is not the way we think. We have a hard time thinking in definitions. We can memorize definitions. DEfinitions are not the way we think - knowing one and being unable to apply it. 
		<ul>Problems: 
			<li>Often it is hard to define things. <span class="ex">Bird. They fly - ostriches and penguins don't fly. They lay eggs - no.</span> There are always exceptions. Even if we know the concept, we have a hard time figuring out what we've seen is an instance of that concept. <span class="ex">Bat or a Sparrow? Squirrel or bird? </span><span class="ex">When romantically engaged, you do things, was that a date? We have an idea of it, but is this one of those?</span> Definitions have ambiguities.</li>
			<li>All things are not equally good category members. <span class="ex">Robin is a great example of a bird, penguin is a lousy example.</span>They vary in typicality and there are unclear examples.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>@@The Probabilistic View@@ Bottom up view. What's typical for that category becomes the way to think about it. You get a central idea of what it is from examples. You learn concepts better by having a good example - ##Prototype##. Once you understand the prototype, you cna make much better classification. <span class="ex">The date: both people have shared mutual affection for one other. A kiss is one way to show that, but not the only one (forced kiss does not show this). Oh, this really fits.</span>Central tendency. Family resemblance - similar without being exact. </li>
	<li>@@@@ top-down concept. You have schemas that you're told about, and they affect how you develop concepts. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Two types of Probabilistic Models </h2>
<p>Abstract idea vs. Examples</p>
<ul>
	<li>@@Prorotype Model@@ We have abstract list of features that are typical of category members. Abstracted ideal of what a _____ is. <span class="ex">Think of a used car salesman. Dishonest, slick, persuasive, talk forever, confident, obnoxious. Prototypes don't have to be that far off from stereotypes.</span></li>
	<li>@@Examplar Model@@ No summary, no abstraction. You remember specific instances and store them in memory. You think of particular instances. Sometimes our categories are defined by a particular example. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Concepts as Theory-based</h1>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>Category membership overrides similarity even in children. <span class="ex">Gelman &amp; Markman (1986). Swallows are more similar to Flamingos than bats. Quite obviously different. </span>Cateogry membership overriding perceptual similarity. The categories are driving th eway things are perceived more than the physical perception. Top-down.</li>
	<li>Goal derived cateogries have no apparent similarity. <span class="ex">Going swimming, painting, jumping rope, eating cookies. Very little perceptual similarity. Daughter's happy activities. </span></li>
	<li>Experts categorize things differently than non-experts. <span class="ex">Classification of wood. Wood is complex for hardwood flooring. Most people will just want to know the colour of it.</span></li>
	<li>Combined concepts - can judge whether somehting fits it. <span class="ex">Muscle car. People can tell you what a muscle car is without knowing what it is. Sports car with big shoulders. </span></li>
</ul>

<h1>Where does this leave us?</h1>
	<p>Classical Approach discredited. The Probabilistic and Theory-based both have merit but two questions remain:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Can the two be differentiated? (can either account explain any finding?) </li>
	<li>When does each account prove most useful?</li>
</ol>
	

<h2>Organization of Categories with Concept</h2>
<p>How do you abstract concepts together? There are three levels. Experts can move between the 3 levels. Non-experts usually think at mid-level. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Superordinate Categories - hard to know what fits and doesn't fit. Animals. What fits and doesn't fit? No common abstractive feature. </li>
	<li>Middle Level or Basic Level Categories. Prototypes are easy to form. Easy to describe and easy to differentiate from others. </li>
	<li>Subordinate Categories - too specific. Hardly anything fits. <span class="ex">Weighting birds.</span></li>
</ul>

<span class="ex">Object hierarchy. Furniture<br>
Table, Lamp, Chair <br>
Kitchen Table, Dining Room Table, floor Lamp, Desk Lamp, (define in terms of what it's used for)
</span>

<span class="ex">Emotionally Unstable<br>
Phobic		Sociopath <br>
Claustrophobic Acrophobic Hydrophobic | Rapist, Strangler, Torturer (very specific)
</span>

<!-- Joni Mitchell Both Sides --> 

<p><a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jonimitchell/bothsidesnow.html">Both Sides Now - Joni Mitchell</a></p>
<p>Clouds you can see from multiple perspectives. Love and life. Clouds, love, life you can view in multiple perspectives. </p>

<h1>Models of Representation</h1>

<p>Once we have categoires, how od objects within the category relate with one aohter? </p>
<ul>
	<li>@@Associative network Models/Activation Spread@@ (Drawn from computer metaphor.) You have one concept and other things connected to it. <span class="ex">You think of table, you think of chair.</span> You have different neurons that are physically connected to others. Some neurons firing lead to other neurons firing. One concept activated, activation spreads to other concepts to which it is connected. (Too simple, but probably not what happens in the brain. Sometimes some are more likely to fire, some are less likely to occur.)</li>
	<li>@@Parallel-constraint Model@@ Multiple neurons going off together - parallel. A much more complicated network. Connections can also lead to deactivation. Spread goes until it's at a stable state. </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<span class="ex">We could end up thinking Donald is Asian. But that's not how it works. Leads to things that don't make sense.<br>Parallel-Constraint-Satisfaction Model - add an inhibitor link. Aggressive would inhibit Asian - so it makes it unlikely that Donald is Asian. (Computational Neuroscience - looks at nervous system and tries to think of a ocmputer model that is consistent with how the nervous system works.) </span>
	
<h1>Heuristics - Shortuts instead of Normative Decision Making </h1>
<p>Heuristics are shortcuts. They are a lot like visual illusions. They are actually mistakes in reasoning. </p>

<p>In general, we are talking about making decisions about how likely things are. Anytime you don't judge for sure. </p>
<h2>Representativeness Heuristic</h2>
<p>We base judgements based on similarity and not other things we should consider. </p>
<ul>Evidence: 
	<li>$$We ignore base-rates$$. ##Bayes Theorem## - if you want the best prediction, you should use base-rates. <span class="ex">What is Tom W.'s Major? Gave a description of Tom W. Asked 3 questions: 
		<ol>
			<li>What is the percentage of people in different majors? </li>
			<li>How similar is Tom W. to each major?</li>
			<li>How likely is Tom W. each major?</li>
		</ol>
	People use similarity and ignore base-rates. "Looks like an engineer, he's an engineer." 
	</span>
	<span class="ex">Is Jack a Lawyer or an Engineer? Jack sounds like an engineer. 1 Condition - took from group with 20/80 Engineer/Lawyers or 80/20. Almost all Engineer sor almost all Lawyers. Did that influence their decision? "the probability that Jack is one of the 30 engineers/lawyers in the sample of 100 is ____%. Whether it was engineer or lawyer did not affect it. </span>
	<span class="ex">Is Dick a Lawyer or Engineer? You know nothing about dick. You should say 30%. People say 50% chance. </span>
	People completely ignore the base-rate and make the decision based on similarity. If they don't sound similar to either one, they use 50/50. If they're given useless information, they say 50/50. <br>If they were given no information, they pay attention to base-rates. 

</li>
	<li>$$violations of logic$$ - What if they didn't have to do math, but just simple logic? <span class="ex">Linda - Bank Teller or a Feminist Bank Teller? Everybody who is a Feminist bank teller, is also a bank teller. It's more likely that she's a bank teller. She sounds like a feminist, so poeple think she is a feminist. </span></li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<h3>Social effects of the representative heuristic </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Consensus Information and the Fundamental Attribution Error. When you look at what was the cause of the behaviour - you have to consider what people usually do (base-rates), which people don't actually do. <span class="ex">Seizure study + attribution about a typical student. Person thinks they're alone or 1 of 5 other people. They have a conversation with other students. One of them has a seizure. Why does the person in the alone condition not help the person having a seizure? People say they're lazy, uncaring. Even if told that almos tno one helps, they still say they're uncaring. Shuldn't make an internal attribution since almost no one helped. It's a situation in which nobody helps. </span></li>
	<li>The Dilution Effect - When you're given all kinds of other information about somebody, it ends up affecting your judgement about that person. <span class="ex">Looked at sentncing for a child molester - What happens if you learn trivial information about them? They have an IQ of 110, they didn't have significantly bad childhoods. They didn't SOUND like they were a molester, but they give a lighter sentence.</span><span class="ex">Murder sentencing for people who actually committed murders. If you tell them their mother loves them, it results in a lighter sentence. They don't seem like a murderer anymore.</span></li>
	<li>Stereotypes - <span class="ex">Locksley. Occupational stereotypes. People ignore stereotypes if they're given a description that doesn't match the stereotype.</span>Not quite that simple.
<ul>
	<li>What you learn about the other person may not counter the stereotype. It may be consistent with the stereotype. Will lead to strong stereotyping.</li>
	<li>Goals and motivation affects processes - they may have a goal to see stereotypes.</li>
	<li>This only happens when the information only completely undermines the stereotypes. Will people use gender as a cue for making height judgement? Unless they give super clear information.</li>
</ul>
		</li>
</ul>

<h3>Qualifications of the Original Findings</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Focussing Attention on Chance Factors increases use of base rates. If people understadn the statistics, people can begin to incorporate it. <span class="ex">Asking people to pull person out of hat, they realize it's based on chance.</span></li>
	<li>Rules of Language may exaggerate findings. Basic way of talking about things is usually based on similarity. If you make it more statistical sounding, people will pay more attention to base-rates</li>
	<li>Order of whether base-rates an indivuating information affects people's use of base-rates.</li>
	<li>People use base-rates when predicting muleiple occurences over time. People can adjust.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Statistical Heuristics - Violating Statisical Ruels</h2>
<p>People ignore a bunch of statistical rules.</p>

<ul>
	<li>$$Poor understanding of probability$$ <span class="ex">Predicting the success of first year students. Given description of person. <br>
		What percentage of descriptions of freshman do you believe would impress you more? People say 5%<br>
		What percentage of freshman will obtain a higher GPA? People say 5% <br> 
		Normative model says that the 2nd question is more uncertain than the first, so the % should be smaller. Is there a good correlation between admissions to university and success? No. Top 5% (admitted) will be on average in the top 20% (GPA). 
	</span></li>
	<li>$$Poor understanding of regression to the mean$$ <span class="ex">Predict score on an IQ test. Not recognizing that performance is part chance, part ability. Put confidence interval around 140. People put 140 right in the middle of the confidence interval. Should have a much wider CI below than above. </span></li>
	<li>$$Poor understanding of the law of large numbers$$ When you have big samples, you get better estimates than small samples. <span class="ex">Hospital problem. Big hospital vs. Small hospital. Which hospital do you think recorded more days where there were more than 60% boys born? Most people say about the same. The answer: the small hospital because of the smaller sample size. 60% is 9/15 vs. 27/45. People aren't paying attention to the fact that large sample sizes provide more precise estimates than small sample sizes. </span></li>
	<li>$$Misperceptions of chance$$ 
<ul>
	<li>Belief in the hot hand - You should pay attention to their average, not what has happened. Do you pay attention last 500 shots over year or last 5 shots in the game. Sports. </li>
	<li>Interpretation of random events - you can have two events that are almost the same, but they seem contradictory. <span class="ex">Casino. They keep winning. What's the probability that they'll win again? Heads or tails. If we see HHHHHH, what's the probability H or T. Peolpe say T, but it's still 50/50. Nobody plays lottery 1,2,3,4,5,6. "If you're stupid enough to play the lottery, it's smart to pick the ones that no one thinks is less likely because no one will split the money." </span></li>
	<li></li>
