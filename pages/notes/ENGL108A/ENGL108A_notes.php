<h1>Why does our culture love superheroes?</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Declining Empire</li>
	<li>Growing Cynicism</li>
	<li>Nostalgia</li>
	<li>Good vs. Evil - Binary (Fantasy) vs. not binary (Reality)</li>
	<li>Justice - System vs. Breaking Arm (Vigilantism)</li>
	<li>Escapism - Vicurious Power Fantasy</li>
	<li>Technology - cheap CGI - visually spectacular</li>
</ul>

<h1>Walter J. Ong</h1>
<ol>
	<li>[2000 BC] Epic Hero. Patron saint of a region, accomplishes notable deeds, representative of state, gods. Greek hero for each region. Make their fame by doing something monumental. </li>
	<li>[1600] Mock-Epic Hero. Blown up version of the epic hero. Too ____. Slumbag to hero. Don Quixote. Comedy. Resulted from boredom. Deadpool. Needs epic heroes to get joke. </li>
	<li>[Early 20th Century] Anti-Hero. Lesser than reader. Lesser morals, weak, stupid. Tied to literacy levels. Batman -> Darker. The Punisher. </li>
</ol>

<p>Heroism defined definitely throughout time. Shift with passage of time.<span class="ex">Batman and Superman used to kill a lot, now they don't at all. </span> Printing technology. Can't ignore medium. Superhero - part god (DC). Religious iconology. Humble beings -> Superhero (Marvel).</p>

<h1>Comics: An Introduction</h1>
<!-- shamus haney - poetic, but distorted. -->
<p>@@Comics@@ <strong>Juxtaposed</strong> pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer. <br>Putting images next to each other. Some believe it's a specific style. Cartoon is a style. Cartoonists = Comic Artist. Try to be art or communicate something. <br>Problem: there are single-image comics. McCloud says single images can imply multiple images. </p>

<h1>History of Comics</h1>

<h2>In the beginning</h2>
<p>Telling stories through sequential images is really old. Older than literature. Cave drawings. Comics are a natural art form. People just do it, don't have to learn it. Language is artificial. </p>

<h2>Peripheral Existence</h2>
<p>Begins with Rodolphe Topffer (1799-1846). The father of comics. 6 panel layout in which people would be doing visually and underneath they would have text describing what was going on. 1 page story. It's a picture book in one page. Good comic book - no redundancy between text and image.</p>
<p>Most visible use: ##Political cartoons##. </p>
<p>William Blake - experiments. Wood cuts. Chisel image on wood and use as stamp. Songs of Innocence. Poems with paintings surrounding them. The pictures carry a great deal of the meaning. </p>
<p>Early uses for comics was an underground culture of pornography. Any visual medium is used for pornography. Entrenches certain perceptions of humans. Buried history - we don't have original comics because they were pornographic and illegal. </p>

<h2>The Boom</h2>
<p>Joseph Pilitzer and William Randolph Hearst were in a war for readership on their nespaper. Pulitzer debuted a comics page. Yellow-Shirt Kid. Talks with a card or his shirt talks. Hearst stole the artist. Pulitzer hired another person to draw the Yellow-Shirt Kid. ##Yellow Journalism## - journalism that tries to one-up the competition. </p>

<h2>From there...</h2>
<p>it exploded. Class becomes an issue. Graphic novels. Superhero genre. Comic Strips. Romance comics - aimed for women. Comics got censored in the 1950s. Comics got hijacked because they were corrupting youth. </p>

<h1>How to Approach a Comics Text</h1>
<p>Rule 1. Comics are not a genre, it's a form. Genre is a template - a series of expectations you have. The type of story of a comic does not matter. Problem: you can pick up a comic book and still have expectations. A lot of comics will play off of those expectations. They will play with them and then do something new with them. </p>
<p>Perspective. The Other to the linguistic Self. When you're looking at a different way of telling a story, it can give us perspective.</p>

<h1>Comics Criticism</h1>

<p>Comics Theory - borrowing ideas.  M</p>
<ul>
	<li>Narrative theory - Art of telling a story. </li>
	<li>Visual Semiotics - studying visual semis.</li>
	<li>Multimodal criticsm - way of telling a story by using multiple modes. Images, smell, sound, text, etc. (Film is image and sound, text is monomodal). </li>
	<li>Caricature - art style. Will stare at you intently and make you uncomfortable and look away and draw you. What they're drawing is the essence of you, the impression of you in their minds. They will not look at you while drawing. </li>
	<li>Fine arts - </li>
	<li>Film Theory - Camera angles, lighting, even performance (get characters to really express what they're feeling at the time). </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
	
<h1>Narrative Justification</h1>
<p>Video games are just literature - a way to live that literature. Why should we consider it as conventional literture?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Comics are narrative</li>
	<li>they're books, </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<p>Biases: comics are for children, theyre about superheroes, lots of masculine fantasy, read and use as toilet paper/insulate your house. Associated with racism. Sensationalism - explosions, epic battles. </p>

<p>The Language of Comics: three languages. </p>
<ul>
	<li>English, or whatever language.</li>
	<li>Comics language - word balloons. <span class="ex">Soeaking vs. Thinking.</span> Things that only happen in comics. <span class="ex">Characters in motion with lines behind them. Lines above character - they are fuming or stinking.</span> They communicate exclusively in comics.</li>
	<li>Visual language - from understanding of visual cues. We are designed to do this unconsciously. Takes an artist to draw complicated facial expressions. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Representation and Selection</h1>
<p>Trying to convey a piece of a long line of images. Choosing one image to represent a lot of other images. <span class="ex">NBA logo. Best angle and image. </span> Choose which one is best of representing something. What happens in between, we assume. ##Motion## and ##Caricature##. Image captures everything it is. ##CAricature## Choice to include eyes, nose, ears, etc. Stephen Harper's nose. Justin Trudeau - hair. Reducing drawings to have their most representative features.</p>

<h1>Gutter</h1>
<p>Gutter - space between panels of the comic. Between text (no images) and film (all imageS). Construct some images. Things happen between panels. Your brain fills in what happened. The reader animates what happens in comics. </p>

<h1>Semiotic Structures</h1>
<p>@@Micro-semiotic structure@@ - individual image. Analyzing just an image. </p>
<p>@@Macro-semiotic: the image in context. Thinking about the juxtapositions. You think about the image in contrast to the other images. Doesn't have to be panels next to it, can be last panel of the book. </p>
<span class="ex">2. Batman punching Joker. 1. Joker raised hands surrendering. 1 affects 2. </span>

<h1>Perspective</h1>
<p>Where you place your camera is important in telling them how to feel. Look up at them. Look down at them. <span class="ex">Maus - like youre in the crowd, dreading your turn.</span><span class="ex">Louis Riel. Trial of Louis Riel. Watching from the side. You're in the jury. The author wants you to judge him.</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Distance</li>
	<li>Eye contact - can they see you or not see you</li>
	<li>Panel Size/Arrangement. The larger the panel, th emore important it is. Rhythmic effect - small panels building to a large panel. </li>
	<li>Quality of Perception - You can only focus on foreground or background. Comics can have both. They can tell you wher eto look by blurring.</li>
	<li>Font - Comic Sans is based on Watchmen lettering. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Serializaiton</h1>
<p>Serialization: a story with a beginning, but no end. Comics can't be like novels. Too expensive. Early days of the novel - had to serialize. Mandate of each issues is to ensure next. Force syou to wrap something up. Sitcoms need resolutions. Limits artists to edit text as a whole. Novelists needs editing. You only get a first draft. You can't discover the story while you're writing it. Restrictions.</p>

<p class="date">Lecture 3: May 9, 2016</p>
<p>Why do we like to read about people who are better than us?</p>
<p>In reality, we hate hearing about people who do things we haven't done yet. But we like reading about people who are better than us. </p>

<ul>
	<li>@@projection@@ - Ideal Ego Theory. Characters you see the worlds through, and characters who are the spectators. Ideal ego - we inhabit their characters. We don't get jealous of them. <span class="ex">TV Shows. Geeky character.</span> Narcissism. We flatter ourselves. </li>
	<li>@@aspiration figures@@ Ubermensch (Friedrich Neitszche) - Overman/Superman. A role model. </li>
	<li>@@vicarious experiences@@ Escapist. We go into a better world. (Theories that you're dead when you're reading.) </li>
</ul>

<p>Not until the anti-hero where we want to read about people less than us.</p>

<p>Birthright quiz. MCCloud </p>

<h1>The Epic Hero</h1>
<ul>
	<li>notable effect on the world - satisfies feeling of importance</li>
	<li>accomplishes noteworthy deeds - epic hero is tied to history. they explain historical concepts.</li>
	<li>usually demi-god</li>
	<li>patron saints of geographic regions - characters representative of their regions. (Professional sports.)<br>The Aeneid. Hired Virgil to write an Epic for the Roman empire. He wrote 3 lines a day. Something everything could identify with it. political propoganda. </li>
</ul>
<span class="ex">Captain America. Is America. Joke: Captain America is how America sees America. The Comedian is how the world sees America. His character changes to reflect what he's representing. He represents the American people, not the government. Extremely nostalgic. Problematic when trying to representing and entire nation. </span>
<span class="ex">Captain Cannuck. Tries to relate to Canadian values. Canada is not a unified nation - it has several different cultures. It only encapsulates broad general stereotypes. </span>
<p>You can't have a character encapsulate a city, and you can't have a character encapsulate a nation.</p>
<span class="question">Why do we do this? Why do we want a character to represent a nation through simplification?</span>
<ul>
	<li>understanding - of nation</li>
	<li>resolution</li>
	<li>loss of identity/group(mob) mentality - feel part of a collective</li>
	<li>can create unity - i want to be like that. </li>
</ul>

<h1>The Epic Tradition</h1>
<p>There was literature before Gilgamesh, but we don't have any. It's the beginning for us.</p>
<ul>
	<li>History, religion, fictional. Society was loose about history. Gilgamesh was a person, he was a king. We've separated superheroes from religious icons, but they didn't back then. The Illyad was the bible of Ancient Greece. Political as well - make me Aeneid for propoganda. Using our fiction to create the values we want. History and fiction is written by the winners - they decide what was or is important.</li>
	<li>Oral tradition - most epics were not designed to be read, they were designed to be spoken. Pneumonics - meant to be recited. They had to be easy to remember. Human beings used to be able to remember novels. Illyad circled for 500 years until someone wrote it down. </li>
	<li>Standard Elements
		<ul>
			<li>@@in media res@@ - starts in the middle. Flash forward/flash back. Harder to follow chronology, but makes audience members pay more attention. </li>
			<li>@@innumeratio@@ - list of combatants. second chapter - list everyone who was there. Theory: people who preformed the stories put their name into the list so it got really big. We still do this by showing each character and what they can do.</li>
			<li>@@anticipatio@@ tells you how it will end - spoiler, but intentional. The story becomes more about how it will happen, and not what happens. </li>
			<li>@@avocatio@@ invocation of the muse. "God wrote it." The idea that it was written by a divine being. </li>
		</ul>
		Some transfer to the Superhero, but not all. 
	</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Epic of Gilgamesh</h1>
<p>2000 BC. Samarion/Babylonian. Was on clay tablets.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Book 1: Surpassing All Kings - about Gilgamesh being awesome even though his people hate him. Focuses bromance with Enkidu. Reflects Sumerian values. How awesome life it is. Flaunts mortality. </li>
	<li>Book 2: He Who Saw the Deep - tale of Gilgamesh's grief for Enkidu. Considered Babylonian. How awful life is. About mortality. </li>
</ul>
<p>Conversion Text. Tell the story of Gilgamesh and then alter things for my new empire. Takes all original ideas, and alters them to their ideas. </p>
<p>Subtheme: one of them wants to do this. they do it. "I'm scared." "Be strong." </p>
<p>Friendship, grief, mortal fear. </p>
<span class="question">How does Gilgamesh Compare to Captain America, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc.?</span>
<ul>
	<li>Sexual Politics - still there, but it's not directly there. It was cool back then. </li>
	<li>Grandstanding/glorious - Gilgamesh is mighty. Awesome image of the superhero. </li>
	<li>Hypermasculinity - Giant the Jack Killer. Someone who is so overpowered who stomps on people who never had a chance.</li>
	<li>Nature vs. civilization - Enkidu's life only has meaning when it becomes civilized.</li>
	<li>Achilles heel - they have this one little weakness that makes them vulnerable. </li>
	<li>Homoeroticism - Gilgamesh and Enkidu - more than just friends. It's subtle now. Wartime stories - lots of homosexual encounters. Our culture tries to ignore them. They were way cooler with homosexuality. Superheroes are all naked. </li>
	<li>Underdog era - Weaker than opponent. </li>
	<li>Resolve - </li>
	<li>value of life - after WWII, life becomes precious.</li>
</ul>
<p>What you're fighting is a reflection of yourself. Dark version of yourself. This is who you could've been if you were selfish. Have to be equal in strength. </p>

<h1>Achilles</h1>
<p>The Iliad. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Effeminate - at least bisexual. Doesn't want to fight even though he's reallly good at it. He crossdresses. Not an honourable hero. Doesn't believe he's bound by contract. Dresses as woman and hides. Untraditional hero. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<ul>He's going to have a... 
			<li>long boring life</li>
			<li>awesome, short life - he accidentally choose this by helping his friend</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>He wanted an awesome, short life then he decided that he wanted a long, boring life. Glorifying battle - political purpose - celebrate violence - more effective soldiers who have no problem of killing. </p>
	
<p class="date">Lecture 4: May 11, 2016</p>
<span class="question">'splosions. Why do we, as human beings, enjoy seeing mass destruction as much as we fear it in reality? </span>
<ul>
	<li>@@catharsis@@ - emotional purge -> repression. We have violent extincts that we have to repress. It satisfies our desires. (No evidence to support watching violence causes violence.)</li>
	<li>@@war-less generation@@ Generation has never been in war. </li>
	<li>@@consequence-free@@ We don't have to deal with the aftermath.</li>
	<li>@@justice@@ People who are bad deserve to get hurt. </li>
	<li>@@closure@@ makes it clear that the battle has been won. </li>
	<li>@@new era/rebirth@@ rain - baptism - rebirth. </li>
</ul>
	
<p>Death in comics. Death sells books. Kill character, bring back to life, and repeat. </p>
<p>In Gilgamesh: First book - celebration of immortality. Second book - going to try and find a cure for death or understanding of what death is.</p>
<span class="question">What does death mean in Gilgamesh? </span>
<ul>
	<li>$$legacy$$ - the great deeds. Don't waste your life. YOLO. </li>
	<li>$$part of life$$ nature itself dies. </li>
	<li>$$inevitable$$ - as much as they are strong, they're still going to die. They can't beat death. Haven't lived if you haven't tried to die. </li>
</ul>
<p>Weeping because of death. In the end, he understands death. </p>

<h1>Diamedes</h1>
<p>Trojan injures Diamedes. Wants to defeat gods. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Aristeia - the chronicle of great deeds. Epic fight scene. The spectacle of violence. It's something we are building towards - it's the selling point. The description of the violence isn't necessary, but it's there. Vivid sex scenes to really engaging dialogue that humans don't use in real life (Gilmore Girls). Draws us to the narrative. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Beowulf</h1>
<p>Transition to English. </p>
<ul>
	<li>written between 8th and 11th century. </li>
	<li>A "dark ages text." </li>
	<li>Anglo-saxon Literature (Old English, but much closer to German/Icelandic)  - 700 years. We have nothing in that era. </li>
	<li>1700-1936 - historical manuscript until he wrote an essay arguing that Beowulf was a piece of poetry, not just historical. They thought it was written by savages.</li>
	<li>Geat (Yowt). </li>
	<li>Comitatus - system of social obligation. Tacitus. Merit-based. <br>Your position on social position is based on success in battles, and not inheritance. Beowulf seeks out this monster because he knows he will achieve great fame. Book 2: olbigation as king. Book 1: how Beowulf earned his kingship. Avengers are seeking for trouble. Certain Avengers are more important than other Avengers - some have done more than others - affects status. <br>Women had status.<br>high calue in personal &amp; family honor. If your father was a great warrior, you had an obligation to be as great or greater.<br>If you are the leader, you are also the leader in battle - front line, not behind the scenes. </li>
</ul>
<p>mascunility, fear of death/conquest death, comeraderie, consequence. Beowulf sad that he has to go fight the dragon. He's an old man - better for him to lay down his life. All of our superheroes are not old. <br>Greed is dangerous. Don't look for things you don't deserve. Reward the people who help you. Superman could rob every bank, but he doesn't. The villain is the superhero who does rob the banks.<br>Beowulf has superpowers - walk under the ocean, rips arms off.</p>
<p>If the superhero is the epic hero, it's an adaptive version. </p>

<h1>Video Games</h1>
<p>Video games are well-suited to superheroes. Why were they bad for so long? </p>
<ul>
	<li>Often bad. </li>
	<li>Aristea = game mechanics. => Good ones. </li>
	<li>Developer laziness - spent all their money on superhero license, and didn't spend money on developing.</li>
	<li>often repackaged existing stories. Not thrilling. You know what's going to happen. </li>
	<li>technology. not good enough to create the spectacle of violence</li>
	<li>voice acting. </li>
</ul>
<p>Batman Arkham Series broke this. Superheroes can be in video games. You can BE Batman. </p>

<h1>The Mock-Epic</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Establishes existing reading of the epic. We had epic hero for a long time and were tired of them. Says that epics are not worth taking seriously. </li>
	<li>Satire vs. Parody. ##Satire## - critique intended to reform. Cabin in the Woods - makes fun of horror films, but it doesn't hate horror films. It suggests that we make better horror films. ##Parody## - open mockery, intended to destroy. Scary movie. No appreciation for horror films. <strong>Mock-Epic is a parody.</strong>Suggestion that it the Epic genre should be destroyed. </li>
</ul>
<p>We have Deadpool, but he loves superheroes as much as he makes fun of them. </p>
	
<p class="date">Lecture 5: May 16, 2016</p>
<p>[VIDEO] Kill Bill: Vol.2. Superman Dialogue. Pop culture critique of superheroes. Superheroes are the superhero and have an alterego. They have to put on a costume to become th esuperhero. Superman was born a superhero, he didn't have to become it. Clark Kent is the critique of human beings. He has to interpret human beings as weak and soft.</p>
<p>Birthright: Clark Kent is the main character, and not Superman. </p>
<p>Is AC accurate?</p>
<ul>
	<li>costume - </li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<p>Superman was one of the first, but then others did it better. It wasn't a good comic. Badly drawn, clunky dialogue. The illustrator was losing his eyesight. The mythology was spectacular. Superman set a template.</p>

<h1>Contemporary History</h1>
<p>Two creators:  </p>
<ul>
	<li>Mark Waid born in 1962, Alabama. Mid 1980s - started with Superman. Best known for Birthright and Kingdom Come (old superheroes who get pushed to the side by an antihero group of superheroes). X-Men: Age of Apocalypse. Daredevil, Fantastic Four, Spiderman. Comic version of SHIELD, and uncanny Avengers. </li>
	<li>Leinil Yu. 1977. From Phillipines. AXIS (X-men and the Avengers). Birthright is one of his earliest work (experimenting). </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<h1>Superman: Birthright</h1>
<ul>
	<li>12 issue limited series. 1 Volume (pretty rare). </li>
	<li>2003-2004. </li>
	<li>Non-canon. Canon - part of official story. It's a what if, has no consequences on the real story. It was originally intended to be non-canon. DC considered it accessible. Hard for new readers to understand because it has been told for 70 years. Superman was considered as a man out of time. This version could be appreciated by young people. Ended up doing really well so they made it canon. </li>
	<li>Replaced 1986 Man of Steel (first reboot). Original ran. Then Man of Steel reboot. Then Birthright reboot.</li>
	<li>Waid wanted a superman who could fail, and feel isolated. Wanted a sympathetic, identifiable Clark Kent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Smallville. Awesome moments. Sympathetic (the Marvel method). Inspires fear (post-Watchmen). Lots of Clark - a lot of his natural personality. Old Clark Kent was ONLY pretending to be a nerd. </p>

<ul>Superman as a comic
	<li>First conceived by Jerry Siegal (writer) &amp; Joe Schuster(illustrator) in 1933 as a villain. THE Superman. Bald. Reconceived as a hero with hair. Rejected by publishers. </li>
	<li>A long time later, sold to Action Comics #1. 1938. DC Comics didn't know they had a hit for months. Because they didn't know it was a hit, there aren't many left. </li>
	<li>Superman is still the beating heart of the DC universe. </li>
</ul>

<ul>What does Superman do? Two types of fantasy: 
	<li>@@Power Fantasy@@ you wish you were more powerful. You can live your fantasies of being powerful. Superman was providing murder. 
<ul>
	<li>Superman Complex. A desire to see other people suffer for righteous reasons while you yourself are untouched. This is something all of us do. We enjoy that grimm, horrible spectacle. Rubbernecking - slowing down to look at the car crash. </li>
	<li>Geek demographic. The geek is no longer an underclass. We no longer look down on people who are smart. Our Clark Kent can be geeky without us resenting him. Deadpool is a massive geek - sounds like he's a fanboy all the time. </li>
	<li>Mad Scientist defeated. Characters that stand in for concepts that scare us. Almost always villains. We were really scared of science. It was automating our jobs. We don't like change. Superman pummels defeats punches scientists. Power of the natural defeating the technological. </li>
	<li>Flight. When they fly above the city, visual metaphor to escape the urban environment. Crowds of people make you feel not special. You want that power to be above it all.</li>
	<li>Importance - messiah complex. Ordinary shlum who discovers they're actually really powerful. Neo from the Matrix, Harry Potter. Everybody cares what he does because he's going to change the world. </li>
</ul>
	
	</li>
	<li>@@Protector Fantasy@@ Like Santa Claus, religion. Ideal being that if you do good things, you will be taken care of. If you do bad things, you will be punished.
<ul>
	<li>Atomic bomb appeasor. Don't want real brutality as they've already seen it. </li>
	<li>Protects the innocent. He didn't do that before WW2. If you are a good person, Superman won't let anything bad happen to you. </li>
	<li>Preserves divide between good and evil. At the time, society needed that. Evil will be punished, good will be rewarded. </li>
	<li>Uses power justly - Superman will not abuse his power. He has the power, but it's okay he has the power. The power was the atomic bomb - everyone feared, had to hope they wouldn't use it. </li>
	<li>Reaffirms the value of human life. Superman will not kill. Even if you commit genocide, Superman wants to bring you to court. </li>
	<li>Preserves the American way. Good if you're American. </li>
	<li>Personification of God. Santa Claus == Jesus Christ.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Before WW2, it was all power fantasy. After WW2, balance between power and protector fantasy. You can't have Superman without a little bit of power fantasy. Power fantasy coming back as WW2 is moving further away. The further we are from global conflict, the more power fantasy. They contradict each other. Hard to have a powerful and non-threatening being. Satisfy both at the same time. Double think - have paradox in your brain, but not recognize it. </p>

<p>How do you think Superman stories can satisfy both at the same time? </p>
<ul>
	<li>empower the villain - Superman has a worthy opponent who he can beat. Lex Luthor in a suit</li>
	<li>reluctant hero - gets to do awesome stuff, but doesn't want to. </li>
	<li>weakness - kryptonite. important narrative for you to feel afraid for Superman. </li>
	<li>extended frailty - superman would lay down his life. What would hurt him is if a bystander gets killed, or Lois Lane. Worried about the people he loves. Not physical threat to Superman, but threat to his loved ones. </li>
	<li>burden of responsibility - if you had the power to save everybody, you would want to save everybody. Can't enjoy life because he can always be saving someone. </li>
	<li>dual-identity - Clark isn't Superman. Clark is a lonely, failure socially, sexually frustrated. He's committed to living a normal life. Sexual frustration gets talked about a lot. The most powerful warriors gets lots of lots of sex, but Superman does not. </li>
	<li>MAslow's Hierarchy of Needs - Superman doesn't need food. Superman doesn't need safety. After that is social acceptance. The one thing Superman needs is social acceptance, which he's not getting. Lois Lane is in love with Superman. Clark Kent is in love with Lois Lane. The thing he desires the most, he does not have it. </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
