<h1>Physiological Psychology</h1>
<p>An interest in the ##nervous system##. Intersection between nervous system and these things: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Mind/cognition - conscioussness, perception, emotion, memory, language.</li>
	<li>Peripheral bodily functions - senstations, internal organs, hormonal endocrine system, immune system</li>
	<li>Behaviour - movement, how you perform tasks </li>
</ul>
<p>EEYou;re older, bad eating habits. You have stroke - preventing bloodflow to specific region of brain. Nervous tissue starts to die. Seem to recover just fine, but people around you that you're neglecting the left side of space. Occurs when people have a stroke that occurs to the right hemisphere - localized in the superior temporal areas and parietal areas. Referred to as ##neglect/spatial/hemispatial/unilateral neglectEE. You fail to pay attention to objects on the left side of space. Damage on right side, ignore left side. Not that you're blind. Visual system is fine. People start to recover over time - shows plasticity - brain can recover after damage. Ignore left side of body. Unaware that they have a deficity - anasognosia. Rare to neglect right side (left damage). ##contralateral representation##. You also neglect left side when you make mental images. Feel like they've perceived everything. Hard to get them to consider the other side. Negative affect linked to the ignored information. Things you tend to ignore, you tend to devalue - rate them as being more negative. Attention and emotion appear to be somehow linked. It's a problem of consciousness.  EE</p>
<p>Split Brain - surgery that cut the ##corpus callosum##. brain conencted by bridge of tissue - corpus callosum. Some patients had heavy cases of epilleptic seizures - overactive electrical brain - electrical storm. Starts in one location and spreads throughout brain. Tensing of muscles, fall over, verbal moans. Maybe if cut corpus callosum, can prevent from spreading to next hemisphere - reduce seizures. It worked. Little disturbance in ordinary daily behaviour, temperament, and intellect of individuals. It seemed like it wasn't so bad. They did experiments to target parts of brain. The two hemispheres have two sperate consciousnesses. The human brain is actually two brains. When cerebrum divided surgically, it's like they have two separate spheres of consciousness. You can get bizarre things going on - alien hand effect - two arms controlled by 2 different hemispheres not talking to each other. EECould have a fight with each other.EE </p>
<p>Procoess visual information in the back of your head - occipital area. You can divide external space down the middle. Right visual field -> left hemisphere. Left visual field -> right hemisphere. Put on left, they don't know. Speech is only on left hemisphere. Speech system can't access the information if it's on the left visual field. ##Lateralization of Function## - some functions are laterlized to one side of hemisphere. There's ##hemispheric assymetry## and there's ##hemispheric specialization##. It was processed by right hemisphere, and left side of body can pick out the object. It has some awareness of what's going on. There are still subcortical connections between hemisphere -but that's not a natural flow of information (agenesis of corpus callosum - developmental compensation). Theory: communication is due to commonality of external world.</p>

<h1>Historical Perspectives</h1>
<p>Focus on key ideas and how they may have changed throughout history. </p>

<p>Early Understanding - Egyptian document bought by Edwin Smith (american archaeologist) - Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus. Sounds like a semi-modern mental textbook. Has an ailment, tells you how to examine that ailment, possible treatments for that ailment. EEGaping wound in the head. Exposed skull, squigglies, throbbing Fontanel. Oil - antibiotic properties. Should not bandage him - want inflammation to leave the brainEE They could've known a lot more than they wrote. </p>
<p>Early Greeks - 400 BCE. Hippocrates and Aristotle. A lot of Greek writings - what they thought about the relation between the body and the mind. At the time, they used "soul". Different schools of thought. 
<ul>
	<li>##Encephalocentrice Theory## - Hippocrates - argued that the brain was the organ that supported the mind. Accurately linked something with an external symptom (epilepsy) was caused by the brain. He understood that some fuunctions are laterlized. IF you disturbed right side of brain, it would effect left side of functioning. </li>
	<li>##Cardiocentric Theory## - Aristotle - the mind and thorughts are generated by the heart. Brain played some sort of role - it would moderate the activiyty of the heart, but the main thoughts came from the heart. If you experience strong emotions, your heart beats faster - so it might be the heart causing things. When people die, heart stops functioning. Heart is associated with a lot of blood, and blood is warm, the heat, life, consciousness. Brain has less blood than does a heart. The brain doesn't have pain receptors - you can poke around without it hurting. That's why you can do brain surgery while the patient is awake/local anesthaesia. </li>
	<li>Epicurus - around this time. Soul is a body of fine particles dispersed around th eentire organism. Soul/mind/self is composed of very fine particles spread around yoru entire body. He says that the soul is a material thing - a set of particles. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Even if you could link mind to physical area or particles, is this illsutrative of a link between something that is a physical material and then mind that's a different substance that's non-material. Or is the mind material itself? </p>
<p>##Psychic Pneuma## - Galen of Pergamon (130-200 CE) - Believed there's an immaterial psychic pneuma that's invisible like air. It was responsible for main aspects of main aspects of conscious eperience - perception, cognition, action. It emenates from ventricles and fills the nerve tubes and animates the individual. (We know now that ventricles, filled with fluid, are spearate from the nerves.)</p>
<p>Rene Decartes (1596-1650 CE) - You have two different substances - the material substance (body) and an immaterial substance (mind/soul) - ##dualism##. ##Monism## - mind and body are of the same substance. ##Antirealism## - monism and it's immaterial. DEscartes argued for a dualistic perspective. The human body is a material machine robot. You have these change sin ventricle pressure that determines behaviour. Some behaviours are just a natural response of this machine. EETouch something that's hot, your arm recoils. It doesn't require consciousness. It's a reflex.EE Animals are completely machine - they don't have a soul. Humans are different cause they have a soul. They are a ghost in a machine. Experiments could be done to test ideas. The mind/soul is an immaterial substance. This immaterial substance communicated with the body through the Pineal gland. The soul would essentially manipulate the pineal gland like a joystick. The seat of the interaction of th ematerial and immaterial would be the pineal gland. It doesn't follow the same physical laws the body does - you have to study the mind a different way. The only way to study, you have to ask people to report what they're feeling - ##introspection##. </p>
<p>Luigi Galvani (1737-1798) - Italian psychologist. (Galvanic skin - measure skin sweat - measure arousal). Already known at the time: electrical stimulation can make the body move, the nerves wwere somehow involved with the communication between the brain and the body but no one knew how they were involved. (Newton believed that the nerves communicated through vibrations like string instruments. Some people believed it was an invisible force) By accident, Galvani's assistant took a scalpel that was statically charged and touched the nerve of an exposed frog leg, and it jumped. Connectign something electrical to the nerve lead to the muscle contraction. Maybe the nerves conduct an electrical impulse. Perhaps there's a key electrical component to the whole system. </p>
<p>Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1822 CE) - believed that the brain was also responsible for personality traits. There were individual differences in certain personality traits - each trait could be localized to a specific part of the brain. If you had a strong degree of a particular personality trait, then that area of the brain would be larger. As that part of the brain grew, it would push out on the skull, need more space, and create a bump on the surface of the skull. By just feeling people's skulls (where the bumps are), you may be able to infer their personality. But first you need to know what traits correspond to what areas. Student - Spurzheim - believed they were being true scientists.<br>It doesn't work. Not a good idea. The idea of a localization of function - that idea has been demonstrated/confirmed in a lot of research. Ethically wrong - if I can infer you have this negative trait, then maybe society needs to do something about it. Ideas can have huge impacts on society/individuals. Need to be cautious. </p>

<p>Johannes Muller (1801-1858) - German physiologist. Did a lot of research on the brain/perceptual systems. Known for introducing the ##law of specific nerve energies##. World -> Body -> Mind. I will get an experience of light and it doesn't matter how I experience it (mechanical or real stimulation of eye). Idea: your conscious experience of the world doesn't entirely/exclusively depend on the nature of the stimulus. Doesn't matter how you stimulate - as long as you stimulate the optic nerve, you're gonna get the  experience of light. There's a disconnect between the stimulus and your conscious experience. What you experience is partly determined by stimulus, but more importantly by your neural substances being activated within your body. Multiple different kinds of stimulation can lead to the same experience. Won't get other types of experiences. Muller was a vitalist. He believed in the energy in the nerves has a not purely physical quality which enables it to travel infinitely fast to the mind. There's something other than purely physical things required. Dualistic. Travelling really fast through the nerves. He had famous students</p>
<p>Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) - German psychologist, student of Muller. OPhthalmoscope, theory of colour vision, theory of audition, speed of nerve condition. Wanted to know how fast. Measured the speed of nerve conduction - Measure response time of a prick. Was very accurate. They were rejecting dualism. It's all just physical activity. Basically, just made a commitment to a particular worldview. They said "we believe." Muller's theorists were identity theorists - the mind is just activity of the brain. It's the same identity. </p>

<p>Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1852-1934) - Spanish physiologist. He wanted to be an artist, but his father forced him into medicine. In the end, he fused medical training and artistry. One of the first ones to look at neurons under the microscope. He would draw out neurons. At the time, people believed that the whole nervous system were formed from one continous fibre, tangled in a very complex web. He discovered that there were little gaps separating individual neurons. It's not a continous fibre, it's a series of individual cells separated by very small gaps. That means that there might be some sort of communication within a particular neuron. Now you have to communicate across some gap. Idea that you have a nervous system composed of separate cells - ##neuron doctrine##. </p>

<p>Paul Broca (1824-1880) - French Surgon. Examined a patient who suffered a stroke, had a massive speech problem (couldn't produce speech), could only say the syllable "tan." -> ##Patient Tan##. He couldn't produce, but he could take language. Whatever the stroke damaged, it damaged areas responsible of language production. Which means there's a specific spot responsible for this function. Broca did an autopsy and discovered a damaged area - argued that the area (##Broca's ARea##) was repsonsible for language production. ##BRoca's Aphasia## - if you have damage to Broca's area. Mouth and lip control, auditory cortex to understand language, Angular Gyrus - writing, Wernicke's ARea - if damage, problems with language comprehension, can produce words, it's a word salad (Wernicke's aphasia), hard time comprehending language as well. </p>

<p>Charles Darwin (1809-1882) - English Naturalist. Natural selection. Individuals vary in terms of some traits, there are environmental pressures out there and people with certain traits survive, they pass on their genes to the next generation and their genes get propagated to future generations. Mutations create new traits that could be selecte dfor in new generations. Organisms through this natural selection evolve. </p>
<p>Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911) - Darwin's cousin. English scholar. Argued that intellectual traits - intelligence, morals, personality, were innate/generated by genetics. So they could be things that could be changed by evolution. There are individual differences in these traits and you could measure them. He produced the correlation coefficient - look at which traits were correlated to other traits. One of the first ones to look at regression. Wanted to identify people with these traits. He said it would be bad if people with all the negative traits were to reproduce and have lots of children. It'd be better if we could take people with positive traits and have them breed to make generations of better people - ##eugenics## - selective breeding of the human population. Nazis. Galton was talking about "positive eugenics" - breed people. "Negative eugenics" - steralize people, stop them from reproducing. This was heavily in play in US/Canada leading up to WW2. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 3: May 9, 2018</p>

<p>Grew into ##Evolutionary Psychology## - cognition and the brain is determined by genetics, therefore it's subject to selective pressure. The kinds of cognitive abilities/brain morphology that are functional are going to be passed down generations, and non-functional will not. Focuses onf unctional explanation. Figure out what those functions were. Focus on past functions. "Our ancestors had... that's why we have..." Typically makes comparisons across species - some degree of relatedness - we come from some organism. Steve Pinker - Blank Slate.</p>

<p>What is the current common view on this? Common view is now: monistic view (only one substance, and that it's matter) - materialism (matter, energy, particles and no other substance); identity position (the mind, consciousness is jsut the activity of the brain/tissue); Reductionism (then we should be able to fully explain all of cognitive functionining and consciousness in terms of the material of the brain. Then we can understand memory, conscious perception, etc. Then we can just talk about neural functioning. Reduce consciousness to basic laws of physics, chemistry, etc. Then all of consciousness can be reduced to basic physical properties of the brain which follows a deterministic, causal sequence. Then you become a biological robot.). Although this is a poipular view, it's based on a certain number of assumptions. </p>
<p>Well known philosopher - David Chalmers - Talks about consciousness and its relationship with the brain. Divides the topic into The Easy Problem (trying to discover what conscious states relate to what source of brain activity - correlational claim. Broca's finding, Neglect. He says that determinign what those relations are easy. It's a solvable thing, just takes time, patients.) and The Hard Problem (Why is there consciousness in the first place? Why would it ever even be? That this organ has this conscious experience. How does brain activity become conscious - 3d theatre? We have no solution for that and no solution forthcoming.) He still wants to be a materialist. The way we're gonna solve it: to stay materialist, must assume that consciousness is a fundamental property of matter. Therefore, you can't explain it. That means that all matter is fundamentally conscious. Chair is conscious, but not as conscious as you are. Brain gives rise to a complex consciousness. Chair has a simple consciousness. Everything around us is conscious.</p>

<h1>Cells of Nervous System</h1>
<p>Cells divided into </p>
<ul>
	<li>##Neurons## - transmit electrical signals and are primary determinants of conition and behaviour. Many individual cells separated by small gaps. Neurons are typically on the outside where it looks a little bit mroe gray - ##Gray matter##. </li>
	<li>##Glia## - believed for a long time that they played more of a supportive role, but now discovering that they play a bigger role. There are different types of glia in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. On images, the white area is the glia cells - ##white matter##</li>
</ul>
<p>Cerebral cortex has 12-15billion neurons. Cerebellum has 70billion neurons. Spinal cord has 1 billion neurons. Whole brain has ~86billion neurons. 1:1 ratio from non-neurons to neurons. In some parts of the brain, you have way more glial cells than neurons (cerebral cortex), opposite in cerebellum. Lots of cells that create a very complex neural network. </p>	

<h2>The Neuron</h2>
<ul>
	<li>##Soma## - cell body</li>
	<li>##dendrites## - contrusion coming out of soma, they end up receiving neurotransmitters</li>
	<li>##axom## - one protrusion from cell body that carries electrical signal.</li>
	<li>##axon terminal/terminal button## - at end of axon</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different shapes of neurons. ##Multipolar Neuron## - Pyramidal, Purkinje. ##Bipolar Neuron## - cell body with two protrusions - one is an axon, the other is a dendridic stalk with dendritic branches. ##Unipolar Neurons## - cell body and only one stalk coming out of the soma. It biforcates and parts that go dendridic and other that is axon. You can classify neurons by shape and also by their function.</p>
<p>Multipolar neurons are usually ##motor## neurons. Bipolar neurons are often ##itnterneuron## - the connect neurons. Unipolar neurons are often found in the ##sensory## system. A neuron's function is related to its shape. Function and shape typically go together. </p>
<p>##Afferent## means to bring information TO a brain area. EEsensory nerves are afferent with regard to the CNS, as they bring information to the CNS.EE ##Efferent## axons carry information away from the neurons EEmotor neurons carry away CNS to the muscleEE. </p>
<p>There are ions, charged particles, that move in and out of an axon - right to the terminal button. Triggers a release of a chemical, the neurotransmitter. Which travels across gap, and attaches to the dendrite of another cell, and that's gonna trigger an eletrial chain within that cell. Ion transfer -> electric charge -> chemical signal -> electrical signal. </p>

<h3>The Soma</h3>
<p>It looks much like any other cell. Within cell, we see a bunch of organelles. Nucleus surrounded by nuclear membrane, which contains the DNA. The nucleolus produces rhibosomes (black dots) - attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rhibosomes create proteins. DNA starts to unzip, gets copied into a messenger, RNA, which leaves nucleus, attaches to rhibosomes, which gets fabricated into a protein. Protein is a building block to your biological system. The Golgi Apparatus packages things into tiny vesicles, a membrane-bound container, which hasnaturotransmitters, proteins, etc. Lysosome has enzymes in it. Golgi Apparatuses package for transport. Neurotransmitters are often packaged inside Vesicles. Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum - makes fats, lipids. The mitochondira - energy production - that area requires a lot of energy. Outside of the cell - a membrane - semipermeable membrane - some things can get in and out, other things cannot. The transport of some molecules is tightly composed. Composed of a phospholipid bilayer - the outsides are water-loving/hydrophilic. The insides are hydrophobic. Extracellular/intracellular fluid. Some things can only move through channels. </p>

<h3>Dendrites</h3>
<p>##Dendrites## - EEhippocapal neuron - dendrite has a dendridic shaft, and on the branch are tiny protrusions, the dendritic spines.EE Dendritic spine has a neck and head. They have proteins that give it structure/form called Actin Filaments. At tip of spine, is the postsynaptic density. Right next to the spine would be another neuron - postsynaptic density. Mitochondria in spine for energy. Post synaptic density has proteins embedded in membrane which are ion channels - with receptors for neurotransmitters - NT will come and attach. Adhesion molecules that connect up to adjacent cell. </p>
<p>Dendritic spines are always dynamically changing. The connections between cells are always morphing and changing. Dynamic system. ##Spine motility##. Down syndrome - too many chromosomes - cognitive impairments, facial morphology, flattening of nasal bridge, etc. 21st chromosome. One of the neural causes: they fail to produce dendritic spines. Spines are important as they increase surface area of dendrites to more connections. Eliminating spines, you can't make as many connections. DS has less connections, less complex cognitive system. </p>

<h3>Axon</h3>
<p>sometines you have a plain axon, other times you have it wrapped by ##myelin sheaths## that come in segments - between segments is the ##nodes of ranvier##. Electrical signal moves down the axon. </p>
<p>Protein complexes that allow ions to move in/out of the cell. They create electric signal that's moving down the axon. Inside the axon has a number of filaments. Actin Filament - narrow, creates structural shape of the cell itself. Neurofilaments - few more protein components, involved in structural support of cell. Muicrotubules - biggest ones, create structural support, and create a highway system within the axon which allows the transport of various types of cargo to the axon terminal from cell body. </p>
<p>Fast Axonal Transport - The cargo/vesicle - big lipid bilayer ball. They're being carried by proteins called motor protein - Kinesen, dynein, myosin Va. Typically one doing the work with the particular cargo. Different motor proteins serve dif functions. </p>
<p>Different motor proteins with dif movements: From soma to terminal, Anterograde Movement, kinesin - carries cargo - starts to untwist, feet, carry the cargo. wound up proteins that unwind.; (If you damage the transport system, it's a real problem cause youc an't get cargo to its destination) REtrograde Movement - from terminal to soma, might be empy veiscles to get them filled up - dynein; myosin va - attaches onto actin filament and cargo and carries it - sideroad - mostly transports to its final destination - into small location, terminal or spine.  </p>

<h3>Axon Terminals</h3>
<p>Hive of activity. Vesicles - some filled with neurotransmitters that are going to be released. We have ion channels for carrying electrical signal down axon, and right at the terminal button. Mitochondira cause you need a lot of energy. Neutrotransmitter - release and communicate with other neutorns. Receptrs for different neurotransmitters - bind an dlead to changes. Transport proteins - brings things you dont need for recycling. Adhesion molecules that are like the one sint he dendridic spine - connect to a particular dendritic spine. </p>
<p>Down the axon, you have axoplasmic transport which moves packages on microtubules. That's very different from the electrical signal being carried by ions thats moving in and out of the cell. Two separate things. </p>

<h3>The Synapse</h3>
<p>The junction between axon terminal and dendritic spine of another clel. There's a space there which is the synapse.  Adhesion molecules connec tiwth each other. They hold them together and control things.Space is the synaptic cleft. Axon terminal before that is the presynaptic terminal. The dendritic spine is the postsynaptic dendrite. Presynaptic/postsynaptic cell. Neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal into the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the PS dendrite. </p>
<p>Very tight, close relation. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 4: May 14, 2018</p>

<h1>Glia</h1>

<p>Neurons - carry electrical signal. Glia - we thought they just had supportive role. </p>

<p>Types of Glia: </p>
<ul>
	<li>##Astrocytes## - star-like cells. A bunch of branches spread out like a star (astro). A number of different functions: form the ##blood-brain barrier## (need a tight barrier betwen blood and brain, must regulate composition of the brain, important cause based on dif concentrations of dif molecules/ions, that'll determine how those neurons function, need to control it tightly, little junctions between capillaries need to be plugged up. Astrocytes have processes and their mtits will plug those holes. BVL = Blood vessels); a nutritioinal role (transferring dif nutrients fromt he blood stream into other glial cells, axons, neurons; gives some structural support - helps create 3D structure of the brain as you dont want it collapsing, keep neurons separate from each other); also have processes that end up isolating various synapses (junction between dendrites and terminals), wraps around that synapse to create an isolated compartment (##synaptic isolation##); something chemical interaction with the synapse (glutamate) - it takes out a lot of the glutamate, recycle it; when you have presynaptic terminal, postsynaptic dendrite, and astrocyte, you have the ##tripartite synapse##; because a single astrocyte can envelope multiple synapses, it can synchronize the activity of the synapses;<br> The ##tripartite synapse## - yellow is the astrocyte, it envelops and blocks off areas - controlling the chemical composition and the events happening at the synapse. Multiple functions</li>
	<li>##Oligodendrocytes## - in the Central nervous system (brain + spinal cord). (myelinating cell) Multiple processes (legs) that come out, they form the myelin sheaths of the neurons in the CNS. 1 can form multiple units of myelin, and myelinate multiple nruons. The process wraps around the axon (a hand) - it functions like an insulator - allows for electircal signal to be conducted more efficiently. </li>
	<li>##Schwann Cells## - in peripheral nervous system. (myelinating cell)Unipolar - one process, biforcates. EAch unit of myelin is created by 1 schwann cell. Creates multiple layers - wraps around to create insulation. Dif from Oligod - if you were to cut an axon in the CNS, the oligd are gonna create a scar and prevent it from regrowing - permanent damage EEspinal injury - can't fix it. EE We don't know how to trigger it to regrow. Olig releases chemicals to prevent regrowth. If cut Schwann cell in PNS (finger - chop, can resew the finger back on - line up main nerves and then over time create a tubular thing and allow it to reform, regain muscle control).<br>Blood brain barrier implies that theres a dif ecosystem in CNS than PNS - there's a dif immune response. IF you were to get an immune cell in PNS, and plop it in hte brain, it may not recognize cells cause they dont have it.  </li>
	<li>##Microglia## - evenly distributed. 1 function: involved in CNS immune response - trigger the immune function. We've learned now that microglia do a lot more - it can remove neuronal precursors during development (they go around clean things up - through a process ##phagocytosis## - it will bump up against a neural precursor, surround and envelop, take it into itself, decompose it, take components and get it out through bloodstream); can also phagocytose an entire neuron (do it to dead neurons and stressed out neurons - a liability and take it out of the system, within 1 hour); Can remove neutrophils (white blood cell), glioma cells (cancerous glial cells); involved in synaptic development and function (microglial process rubbing up against synaptic cleft, it will rythmically come close to and move away from synapse - unclear exactly what the function is, but they secrete some growth fators that allow the synapse to grow stronger); [Allt hese things are working together - complicated combination of mechanics that make the system work.] ##Synaptic pruning## (enveloping part of synapse, and elminating it through phagosytosis - eliminating the connection. Then that axon may sprout another terminal and connect up to a different part of a dendrite.)</li>
	<li>##Radial Glia## - present heavily during development, especially during early dev. Mostly removed in early adulthood. Most of the cells in our CNS, grow out of a line of cells that line the ventricles (fluid filled sacs within brain). Some of the stem cells divide into radial glia cells that extend to the surface of your cortex. Some of the stem cells (in ventricle) become neurons and some will climb to find their resting place in the cortex. Radial glia provide a scaffolding for these migrating neurons so they can find their ultimate location. You still have some of these in your eye. </li>
	<li>##Polydendrocytes## (NG2 Cells) - lots of processes. They can hang around, if you start to damage oligodendrocytes, they will transform into an oligodendrocyte to remylenate - take the role of th edamaged oligodendrocyte. Certain cells don't just stay as being one type of cell, they chang ethemselves. All cells have the same genetic information. What makes it a partic cell is what segments of the gene are turned on or off. PRotens make it into a particular cell. When tehere's signaling molecules, it can change which genes are expressed and what kind of cell it can become, what it cna do. Stem cells are those that can become anything, depending on their chemical surrounding, the context they're in. ARgument was: once they become a different cell, they are fixed, but not the case for polydendrocytes. Cells are not fixed, they can change. They can also form synapses and carry dendrocytes (not just neurons do this) - can embed themselves and pass through multiple layers of cells, they may be important in coordinating the activity between cells. Pass through a lot of different neurons and electrically synapse with the neurons - breaks the boundary between neurons and glia. </li>
</ul>

<p>##The Blood-brain barrier## - Endothelial cells makes up the cappliary wall, they junctions are tight. And astrocytes plug it up as well. Allows for a lot of control to what gets in or out of the brain. What is allowed to move passively (green) are some gases and a few fat-soluble molecules (vintamin A, d). Other molecules like glucose, hormones, amino acids, and non fat souble vitamins require active transport. There are transporters that get those out of the bloodstream and into the CNS. Astrocytes mediate. IF you break blood-brain barrier (radiation, toxins, cigarettes) EEAddiction happens more efficiently if you can shorten the time period between taking drug and shortening time it takes to effect. Nicotine - get it through the blood brain barrier and into brain as fast as you can. Add other things into cig that make it move faster. Some of the toxic chemiclas are designed to help nicotine through the blood brain barrier faster, what you don't want. Other chemicals with flavours - cyanide, tar - all of them end up damaging blood brain barrier. Pharmaceutical companies are battling with this cause they have to figure out how to deliver efficiently to your brain - how to take a ride on these active transporters.EE</p>

<h1>The Action Potential </h1>

<p>Electrical signal going down the neuron. There's an electrical signal that starts at the axon hillock, or first ode of ranvier - travel downt he axon (in one direction) to the terminals. The electrical signal depends on the ions (charged particles0, their concentration inside the axon and outside. Inside: ##intraceulluar fluid##, ##extra cellular fluid## (outside). The difference between inside and outside that creates the energy for electrical signalling. </p>
<p>Sodium (Na+), Chloride (Cl-), Potassium (K+) - electron missing or adding, making them charged particles. </p>
<p>Seawater - high in sodium, chloride, low in potassium - makes salt (NaCl). Extracellular fluid (surrounding neurons in your brain) - very similar to seawater - high sodium, chloride. Intracellular fluid - a lot more potassium than sodium, chloride. This imbalance leads to an electrical difference. </p>
<p>Inside of cell is a lot more negative relative to outside of cell. Voltemeter electrode inside axon: measures -70 millivolts when axon is at rest - this is called the ##REsting potential## - no major electrical activity happening inside the cell. </p>
<p>Outside of cell has a lot of sodium+chloride ions. Inside has more potassium ions. Why is inside negative? NEgatively charged protein molecules inside the cell - so big that they can't get out - they tip the scales so overall, the inside is way more negative than the outside. Ions are the movers and shakers - they move in and out of the cell because inside the membrane are protien channels - closed/open. Every ion has its own channel it can move in and out. Important on channels: they open/close depending on the voltage across the membranes - ##voltage-dependent channels##. Another protein: the ##sodium-potassium pump## that allows sodium/potassium under certain circumstances. Channel is gonna work without energy, pump requires energy to work. Need pump because ions are in the wrong compartment and need to use energy to get them back to the write compartment. [Positive and negative - relative to each other. -70, 0 means they're realtively equally charged. -70 means you're -70 more negative.] </p>
<p>We wanna move ions across to create electrical activity - what drives it are: 1) ##diffusion## - movement of molecule sfrom areas of high concentration to low concentration across a gradient. (drop of colour in water - concentrated and diffuses out); 2) ##electrostatic force## - these are charged particles and like particles repel, opposites attract. "This might be true about love, but we don't know about that." </p>
<p>Potassium is a lot more concentrated on inside of cell - diffusion would want to push it outside the cell. Because potassium is + and the outside of cell is more +, electrostatic force would wanna push it into the cell. Diffusion and Electrostatic force opposing each other. Chloride (blue) - heavily on outside, diffiusion would wanna push it into cell. But because chloride is -, and intercellular is -, electrostatic force would wanna push it out of the cell -> opposing forces. Sodium is more concentrated outside, so diffusion wants to push it into the cell. It's also + and extra cellular is + so it wants to push it into the cell. If you opened the soidum channel, they would rush into the cell - it would change the electrical difference. Sodium has a parimary imabalance occurring. Other thing we'll see with pump - it will pump sd=odium ions back out and exchanging them with potassium ions, pushing them inside. Pump requires energy - it creates the imbalance - pushing more sodium ions outside. </p>
<p>Potassium channel - cell membrane (green). Protein structure. Closed format - not enough physical space to pass ions in and out. Once opened, it unwraps, it opens a physical pore that allows ions to pass through. Channels are voltage activated. What triggers opening and closing of these is the electrical difference. </p>
<p>Soidum potassium pump - helps create electrical gradient. Has mechanism that allows 3 sodium to exit and at the same time, bring 2 potassium inside cell. Exchange mechanism. Requires energy. </p>

<p>What happens if we were to stimulate the system: look at what happens on our voltemeter. Resting potential: -70. WE can electrically near axon hillock and add some positive charge - then if we measure axon, we would see that it became a little less neg on the inside (cause we added positive charge) - this is ##depolarization## - decreasing - making inside and outside a little more similar. If we inject a little mor eneg charge to axon area - would make inside more negative - ##hyperpolarization## - increasing electrical potential across membrane. Each cell has a ##threshold of excitation## - if we put enough of a positive charge in there to depolarize a cell beyond that point, you would trigger a massive electrical change claled the ##action potential## - it hits the threshold, all this activity breaks loose, you get a massive depolarization - called the ##upstroke## - it hits 0, becomes equivalent, then you get an overshoot, the inside a little mor epositive than outside, and it reverses and you get a downstroke, becoms more neg on inside again, get more neg than resting potential (##afterhyperpolerazation##), then return to resting potential. That's if we're looking at one location on the axon. Peak to the trough - spike height. </p>
<p>What happens to membrane as action potential unfolds. Potassium channels are slightly open. Slow exchange of potassium in resting state. If stimulate, add a bit more positive charge to axon, and brought to threshold, the soidm channels open, a lot of soidum enters the cell, making the inside of the cell less and les sneg, and more and more pos. The sodium channels open because you hit the threshold of excitation - automatic. The potassium channels open as well - potassium leaving the cell (cause gettign mroe and more pos in there) and some sodium entering the cell. Until you hit the +40, peak, the sodium channels will close and potassium keeps exiting the cell - massive downstroke because potassium is leaving. Potassium channels will close (overshoots hits bottom), then some potassium diffuses away from that location and go to other places, brings it back to its resting state. It returns because excess potassium on outside diffuses away. S-P pump comes in, pumping sodium out, potassium in to regain the original balance where theres a lot more sodium on outside and potassium inside. But it's not pump that gets it back to its resting state. </p>
<p>It's the soidum that has both diffusion and electrical gradient forcing it into the cell. It rushes in - potassium wants to get out. </p>
<p>The action potential travels downt he axon. While time is unfolding, ##absolute refractory period## - cannot trigger another action potential. When in hyperpoerized state, it's ##relative refactory period## - you can trigger another action potential, but you need a lot more stimulation. </p>
<p>Not all neurons are the same with their action potentials. </p>
<p>They faollow an all or none law - once you trigger, it's gonna happen. Independent of the intensity of the stimulus. As long as you have stimualtion, you get the same-sized action potential. Not a bigger action potential, you'll just make more action potentials in a shorer period of time - fires faster. Firing rate of neurons. </p>
<p>Can't go back on axon because of refactory period. Regenerate downstream. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 5: May 16, 2018</p>
<p>Propagation of the action potential. Action potential is an electrical signal that travels down the axon. Stimulate the axon, see action potential in A, then B, then C. Continuiusly regenerating the action potential. Remain full size at every location. Propogation occurs in 2 dif ways, depends on whether or not hte axon is mylenated. Some axons do not have any myelin sheaths. Prop occurs through ##passive conduction## in unmyelinated axons and ##salltitory conduction## in myelnated axons. Passive conduction - stimulus, positive charged ions move to the adjacent area, depolarizing it; causes sodium to rush into the cell in the new location; it continues on. It's relatively slow beecause it requires a regeneration of action potential in adjacent regions of the axon. When you have myelin sheaths (salitory conduction - once an axon gets sheathed, it eliminates some of the sodium channels; lots of sodium channels at nodes of ranvier; when you stimulate/depolarize a partic region, sodium rushes into the cell, the positive ions flow all the way to the next node of ranvier; depolarize the region of next node of ranvier, depolerizes and recreates action potential; the action potential jumps from node of ranvier to node of ranvier - a much faster form of conduction; development creates myelin sheaths and speeds up and improves stuff. </p>
<p>##Multiple sclerosis## - an autoimmune disease whereby the immune system attacks the cells in the CNS. What can happen: you can increase the gap between cells that form the blood vessel walls, it allows immune cells, white blood cells to enter the brain - leak through the wall. The oligodendrocyte is quite different - don't recognize oligodendrocyte - it must be a foreign invader - attack those cells. Immune cells attack oligodendrocytes and break them down. Results in demylenation of segments of the axon. Affects white matter in dif locations of the brain - determines the symptoms (weakening of muscles - attack of motor system, visual system - blurry vision, slow decision making). Might develop symptoms, then go into remission, then new symptoms come back. A cycle of increasing symptoms, remission, and getting new symptoms. This is cause the body is able to remylenate some of these axons. NG2 can change into oligodendrocyte to remylenate. Sodium channels were removed from the myelenation so nto enough to propagate action potential. System tries to fix itself by attaching new sodium channels. The brain is learning to compensate for networks affected. First stage - tryna fix itself. Second stage - axons are dying, not enough networks to compensate anymore, symtpoms get worse and worse. A steady downhill. Myelin not used, axon deteriorates. Then you get a retraction bulb - scars over, stuff accumulates. [There are many things in our environment that create an inflammatory response. That inflammation response in preipheral body damages your blood cell walls. Some immune cells wreak havoc in the brain. ] </p>
<p>Key triggers of inflammation of body occurs from the activity in the microbes in the guy. When you eat gluten, it can cause an inflammatory bowel problem - inflammation in the bowels. Most of the wheat we consume has been genetically modification. Changes nature of gluten which out bodies can't tolerate. <Br> You have a health intestine - bacteria that reduces inflammation, resident inflammation, opportunistic pathogens, but it's ok cause you got a lot of good stuff. lllSome nutrients will come up, into the bloodstream, sent out all over your body. T cells - white blood cells that go out and fight off infections. If you mess up the bacterial composition of gut - Disbiosis - lots of opportunistic pathogens - damages the mucus membrane, alloweing some of the bacteria that are supposed to stay in your gut to leave gut and into bloodstream. System needs to attack the bad stuff in the bloodstream - generates immune cells/imnflammatory mediators - they destroy the invaders - you end up hitting your own cells - too much inflammation destroys your own cells. Starts to destroy blood brain barrier and increase the gaps between those cells. Proinflammatory mediators and immune cells entering the brain, they start to think that oligodendrocytes are foreign subjects. And microglia thinking they need to activate their immune response and keep damaging the cells in CNS. Then you end up with MS. What's happening in your gut determines neuro functioning and can trigger a degenerative disease. </p>
<p>Over 90% of seratonin is in your gut. Multiple channels between what's happening in your gut an dwhat's happeniing in your brain. </p>

<h1>The Synapse</h1>
<p>The synapse involves a presynaptic axon terminal and a post-synaptic dendritic spine. They're connected by protein strands - ##adhesion molecules##. The gap is the ##synaptic cleft##. The communicatoin that happens across the cleft occurs through chemicals called ##neurotransmitters##.</p>

<p>NEurotransmitters - different classes of neurotransmitters. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Amines - molecules that are derived from amino acids (basic building blocks of proteins from our diet). Catecholamines (all derive from Phenylalalnine. TRanslates to Tyrosine, translates to Dopa, to Dopamine, changed to norepinephrine, epinephrine. Arrow is an enzymatic step. These 3 are a sequence that derives from Phenylalanin. PKU - huge buildup of Phenylananaline - ensure that no Phenylanalines are in your diet, and supplement for Tyrosine), Idolamines (Tryptophan in your diet goes through a series of stages to make Serotinin and ultimately can end up with Melatonin, also a hormone), Acetylcholine (a byproduct of metabolism - acetyl coenzyme A and choline). The main neurotransmitters in your brain depend on your diet. What you eat will affect your brain chemistry. Diet may be a very important component for mental problems. </li>
	<li>Amino Acids - TAKE IN THROUGH your diet. GABA (major inhibitory neurotransmitter), glutamate - excites neurons, glycine, others</li>
	<li>Peptides - chains of neuroacids - </li>
	<li>Gases - carbon monoxide (it's active in your CNS), nitric oxide (a free radical - NO-. One of the radicals produced during inflammatory response, can dmage your own cells, also a neurotransmitter). Body uses a single thing for multiple things. Might bring one ting to balance and unbalance another. </li>
	<li>Other small molecules - ATP (produced by mithocondhria for energy), Adenosine (byproduct of ATP)</li>
</ul>

<p>Start in the presynpatic axon terminal. A microtubule coming in. You can get vesicles being transported, packaged with neutotransmitters. Axonal Transport. Some other types of neutotransmitters are synthesized and packaged in the axon terminal - empty vesicles. Now you have vesicles filled with NT in the terminal button. Through Translocation, some of those vesicles come up to the cell membrane in a place called the ##active zone## - has a whole bunch of proteins in it (SNARE proteins - will attach to cell membrane and the membrane of the vesicle - both have lipid bilayer membranes -same kind of membrane). This process is Docking, it goes through slight chemical change - Priming - preparing it to be released in the synaptic cleft. Vesicle pools. The vesicles are organized into different pools - active zone has a pool of vesicles that is readily releasable pool - they will release contents into synaptic cleft when the action potential comes and depolarizes. The recycling pool - after releasing, they're empty and get refilled and are ready translocate back to the active zone - active recycling process (5-20%). Vast amount of vesicles that aren't often released - the Reserve pool - call up the reserves (once you blow therough your regular men and women). You're not gonna easily run out of vesicles cause of these reserves. </p>
<p>Voltage dependent sodium, potassium channels. The action potential arrives at the axon terminal, at the end here, when sodium enters the cell, it depolarizes the terminal button region.  And you have calcium ion channels - 2+ charge, so when depolarize, calcium flows into the axon terminal. The calcium comes up to the docked vesicles and leads to Calcium-dependent exocytosis - releases NTs. The cell membrane of vesicle fuses with the cell membrane of the axon terminal, sometimes it fuses a bit, opens a pore and pinches off into a vesicle, other times it fuses completely. The axon terminal gets bigger, but there's a fix to that problem. </p>
<p>The SNARE proteins are involved in mediating the exocytosis (out). Proximal monolayers will start to fuse with one another, they create a fusion stalk; a depression starts to occur as snare proteins pull things apart in the sides, creates a hemifusion ( a depression); create a rip through centre, a pore; then  neurotransmitters will go through this pore. Then it can completely fuse or reverse the process. Snare protein activit y is triggered by thte calcium coming in. </p>
<p>Reverse happens - Endocytosis (in) - a bit of the axon terminal membrane forms a vesicle. Then you have a nurotransmitter uptake, bring sin NT into vesicle and it's ready -> Vesicle Recycling. </p>
<p>In the postsynaptic - you have some ion channels. Some of the ion channels have receptors on them. The receptors are there for connecting to the NTs. NT will attach to ion channel and open the ion channel allowing ions to flow in or out. Sodium in there, then you bring it closer to threshold. Enough positive, depolarization, can trigger an active potential. You're getting an electrical signal  to a chemical signal then attach, allowing ion channels to flow ion in/out. Then electrical changes in postsynaptic cell.</p>
<p>Ligand-Dependent - based on a ligand binding to them - Ligand = NT. It functions on a lock and key type mechanism. Ion channels will have receptors that are a specific lock. Each NT is a dif key. Each NT TYPE will activate a  dif receptor. Lock and key specificity. It's a physical shape of the NT that fits in there. Ion channels opening in a dif way, by a ligand connection. </p>
<p>Not always will sodium flow in - depends on the channel. Typically effects can be categorized as excitatory or inhibitory - EPSP or IPSP. It's a graded change. Brigns you a little closer to threshold and dissipate. Based on ions entering and leaving. Excitatory - increase likelihood of action potential - it's graded - can open a few or a lot of channels - graded depolerization - small or huge. IPSP - graded hyperpolerization, brings neuron away from threshold. </p>
<p>If small, how do you trigger action potential? 1) way: ##Temporal Summation## - rapidly repeatedly stimulating through a given axon. Bit of depolarization starts to fade, but before it fades, add another action potential, and now you depolerizes enough and it triggers. Summing over time rapid action potentials in succession, leading to enough of a depolarization for action potential; 2) ##Spatial summation## - multiple axons - that add over space to depolarize the neuron enough to trigger an action potential. Do it enough to trigger action potential.  </p>
<p>##Neural Integration## - exitatory and inhibitory signals - a bit of depolarization, a bit of hyperpolerization - they sum together is with no change at all. Excitation cancels out the inhibition and vice versa. </p>

<p>A NT comes in and it'll attach to the ##binding site## (lock and key). It causes the ion channel to poen, and now ions can move through. ##Ionotropic receptor## - the receptor site is right on the channel, it's integral to the channel. A ribbon diagram - divided into a series of units  and it goes right through the membrane - they will unwind a bit and increase the size of the space in the middle.  Another type of receptor: ##Metabotropic Receptor## - have a receptor segment/protein in one part of the membrane and the actual ion channel is in a separate location. A protein that's added to the receptor. NT goes to receptor site, triggers the release of some of the units of the G-protein which attach to the IOn channel, causing it to open. NT -> messenger -> ion channel. </p>
<p>Why 2 diff? Ionotropic REceptors are very quick responders and short-lived responses. effects last Less than 10ms. Very, very fast. Metabotropic Receptor - slower and longer lasting - effects last at least 10s. Takes time to go through process, but it's open for longer. IT allows for dif kinds of neurocognitive effects. EEFor hearing, you need rapid responses - need ionotropic. For other things like regulating your body temperature - that can take a little longer. Or certain kinds of pain, modulating sleep. Those you can have longer lasting effects that occur at dif rates. EE </p>

<p>Some NTs can have both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors - diff concentrations in dif parts of system. Sodium - excitatory. </p>

<p>Once you get an activation of ion channels, then the NT is detached. It can do a number of dif things: 1) NT is reuptaken by presynaptic terminal - by transporter proteins. Pumps it back in and repackaged into vesicles to get reused; 2) feedback effects - NT connects to another type of receptor called the ##autoreceptor## - it binds and sends a signal to the inside to say that it's enough; 3) deactivation of the NT - done by enzymes which breaks the NT into pieces, gets taken in, reformed, reused; 4) diffusion - just gets diffused away. The astrocyte can actually absorb some of the NTs; What could happen also is Retrograde Transmission - transmitters released out of the postsynaptic dendritic spine - exocytosis, autoreceptor in presynaptic, which signals feedback to stop releasing. </p>

<p>Key principles: You have 3 dif types of NTs, they each activate a particular metabotropic receptor, and each of those can converge on affecting a particular G protein, which can open a potassium channel. Different NTs can have the exact same effect on the exact same channel. </p>
<p>##Divergence## - single thing ends in multiple outcomes. One NT which activates an ionotropic receptor which oepns a chloride channel, and another receptor which activates G proten and potassiumc hannel. Can have 2 dif effects. Gives the brain a lot of flexibility. It all depends on what kind of ion channels. Want a case wehre multiple people can access a single room and a single person access multiple rooms. </p>
<p>Astrocyte has NT transporters and ion channels, receptors for NT - can trigger release NT-like chemicals fromt he glia - gliotransmitters. Interaction with astrocyte is also critical. Multiple things going on. Glutamate is also a fundamental glial transmitter. </p>
