<h1>Physiological Psychology</h1>
<p>An interest in the <span class="key">nervous system</span>. Intersection between nervous system and these things: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Mind/cognition - conscioussness, perception, emotion, memory, language.</li>
	<li>Peripheral bodily functions - senstations, internal organs, hormonal endocrine system, immune system</li>
	<li>Behaviour - movement, how you perform tasks </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="ex">You;re older, bad eating habits. You have stroke - preventing bloodflow to specific region of brain. Nervous tissue starts to die. Seem to recover just fine, but people around you that you're neglecting the left side of space. Occurs when people have a stroke that occurs to the right hemisphere - localized in the superior temporal areas and parietal areas. Referred to as <span class="key">neglect/spatial/hemispatial/unilateral neglect</span>. You fail to pay attention to objects on the left side of space. Damage on right side, ignore left side. Not that you're blind. Visual system is fine. People start to recover over time - shows plasticity - brain can recover after damage. Ignore left side of body. Unaware that they have a deficity - anasognosia. Rare to neglect right side (left damage). <span class="key">contralateral representation</span>. You also neglect left side when you make mental images. Feel like they've perceived everything. Hard to get them to consider the other side. Negative affect linked to the ignored information. Things you tend to ignore, you tend to devalue - rate them as being more negative. Attention and emotion appear to be somehow linked. It's a problem of consciousness.  </span></p>
<p>Split Brain - surgery that cut the <span class="key">corpus callosum</span>. brain conencted by bridge of tissue - corpus callosum. Some patients had heavy cases of epilleptic seizures - overactive electrical brain - electrical storm. Starts in one location and spreads throughout brain. Tensing of muscles, fall over, verbal moans. Maybe if cut corpus callosum, can prevent from spreading to next hemisphere - reduce seizures. It worked. Little disturbance in ordinary daily behaviour, temperament, and intellect of individuals. It seemed like it wasn't so bad. They did experiments to target parts of brain. The two hemispheres have two sperate consciousnesses. The human brain is actually two brains. When cerebrum divided surgically, it's like they have two separate spheres of consciousness. You can get bizarre things going on - alien hand effect - two arms controlled by 2 different hemispheres not talking to each other. <span class="ex">Could have a fight with each other.</span> </p>
<p>Procoess visual information in the back of your head - occipital area. You can divide external space down the middle. Right visual field -> left hemisphere. Left visual field -> right hemisphere. Put on left, they don't know. Speech is only on left hemisphere. Speech system can't access the information if it's on the left visual field. <span class="key">Lateralization of Function</span> - some functions are laterlized to one side of hemisphere. There's <span class="key">hemispheric assymetry</span> and there's <span class="key">hemispheric specialization</span>. It was processed by right hemisphere, and left side of body can pick out the object. It has some awareness of what's going on. There are still subcortical connections between hemisphere -but that's not a natural flow of information (agenesis of corpus callosum - developmental compensation). Theory: communication is due to commonality of external world.</p>

<h1>Historical Perspectives</h1>
<p>Focus on key ideas and how they may have changed throughout history. </p>

<p>Early Understanding - Egyptian document bought by Edwin Smith (american archaeologist) - Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus. Sounds like a semi-modern mental textbook. Has an ailment, tells you how to examine that ailment, possible treatments for that ailment. <span class="ex">Gaping wound in the head. Exposed skull, squigglies, throbbing Fontanel. Oil - antibiotic properties. Should not bandage him - want inflammation to leave the brain</span> They could've known a lot more than they wrote. </p>
<p>Early Greeks - 400 BCE. Hippocrates and Aristotle. A lot of Greek writings - what they thought about the relation between the body and the mind. At the time, they used "soul". Different schools of thought. 
<ul>
	<li><span class="key">Encephalocentrice Theory</span> - Hippocrates - argued that the brain was the organ that supported the mind. Accurately linked something with an external symptom (epilepsy) was caused by the brain. He understood that some fuunctions are laterlized. IF you disturbed right side of brain, it would effect left side of functioning. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Cardiocentric Theory</span> - Aristotle - the mind and thorughts are generated by the heart. Brain played some sort of role - it would moderate the activiyty of the heart, but the main thoughts came from the heart. If you experience strong emotions, your heart beats faster - so it might be the heart causing things. When people die, heart stops functioning. Heart is associated with a lot of blood, and blood is warm, the heat, life, consciousness. Brain has less blood than does a heart. The brain doesn't have pain receptors - you can poke around without it hurting. That's why you can do brain surgery while the patient is awake/local anesthaesia. </li>
	<li>Epicurus - around this time. Soul is a body of fine particles dispersed around th eentire organism. Soul/mind/self is composed of very fine particles spread around yoru entire body. He says that the soul is a material thing - a set of particles. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Even if you could link mind to physical area or particles, is this illsutrative of a link between something that is a physical material and then mind that's a different substance that's non-material. Or is the mind material itself? </p>
<p><span class="key">Psychic Pneuma</span> - Galen of Pergamon (130-200 CE) - Believed there's an immaterial psychic pneuma that's invisible like air. It was responsible for main aspects of main aspects of conscious eperience - perception, cognition, action. It emenates from ventricles and fills the nerve tubes and animates the individual. (We know now that ventricles, filled with fluid, are spearate from the nerves.)</p>
<p>Rene Decartes (1596-1650 CE) - You have two different substances - the material substance (body) and an immaterial substance (mind/soul) - <span class="key">dualism</span>. <span class="key">Monism</span> - mind and body are of the same substance. <span class="key">Antirealism</span> - monism and it's immaterial. DEscartes argued for a dualistic perspective. The human body is a material machine robot. You have these change sin ventricle pressure that determines behaviour. Some behaviours are just a natural response of this machine. <span class="ex">Touch something that's hot, your arm recoils. It doesn't require consciousness. It's a reflex.</span> Animals are completely machine - they don't have a soul. Humans are different cause they have a soul. They are a ghost in a machine. Experiments could be done to test ideas. The mind/soul is an immaterial substance. This immaterial substance communicated with the body through the Pineal gland. The soul would essentially manipulate the pineal gland like a joystick. The seat of the interaction of th ematerial and immaterial would be the pineal gland. It doesn't follow the same physical laws the body does - you have to study the mind a different way. The only way to study, you have to ask people to report what they're feeling - <span class="key">introspection</span>. </p>
<p>Luigi Galvani (1737-1798) - Italian psychologist. (Galvanic skin - measure skin sweat - measure arousal). Already known at the time: electrical stimulation can make the body move, the nerves wwere somehow involved with the communication between the brain and the body but no one knew how they were involved. (Newton believed that the nerves communicated through vibrations like string instruments. Some people believed it was an invisible force) By accident, Galvani's assistant took a scalpel that was statically charged and touched the nerve of an exposed frog leg, and it jumped. Connectign something electrical to the nerve lead to the muscle contraction. Maybe the nerves conduct an electrical impulse. Perhaps there's a key electrical component to the whole system. </p>
<p>Franz-Joseph Gall (1758-1822 CE) - believed that the brain was also responsible for personality traits. There were individual differences in certain personality traits - each trait could be localized to a specific part of the brain. If you had a strong degree of a particular personality trait, then that area of the brain would be larger. As that part of the brain grew, it would push out on the skull, need more space, and create a bump on the surface of the skull. By just feeling people's skulls (where the bumps are), you may be able to infer their personality. But first you need to know what traits correspond to what areas. Student - Spurzheim - believed they were being true scientists.<br>It doesn't work. Not a good idea. The idea of a localization of function - that idea has been demonstrated/confirmed in a lot of research. Ethically wrong - if I can infer you have this negative trait, then maybe society needs to do something about it. Ideas can have huge impacts on society/individuals. Need to be cautious. </p>

<p>Johannes Muller (1801-1858) - German physiologist. Did a lot of research on the brain/perceptual systems. Known for introducing the <span class="key">law of specific nerve energies</span>. World -> Body -> Mind. I will get an experience of light and it doesn't matter how I experience it (mechanical or real stimulation of eye). Idea: your conscious experience of the world doesn't entirely/exclusively depend on the nature of the stimulus. Doesn't matter how you stimulate - as long as you stimulate the optic nerve, you're gonna get the  experience of light. There's a disconnect between the stimulus and your conscious experience. What you experience is partly determined by stimulus, but more importantly by your neural substances being activated within your body. Multiple different kinds of stimulation can lead to the same experience. Won't get other types of experiences. Muller was a vitalist. He believed in the energy in the nerves has a not purely physical quality which enables it to travel infinitely fast to the mind. There's something other than purely physical things required. Dualistic. Travelling really fast through the nerves. He had famous students</p>
<p>Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) - German psychologist, student of Muller. OPhthalmoscope, theory of colour vision, theory of audition, speed of nerve condition. Wanted to know how fast. Measured the speed of nerve conduction - Measure response time of a prick. Was very accurate. They were rejecting dualism. It's all just physical activity. Basically, just made a commitment to a particular worldview. They said "we believe." Muller's theorists were identity theorists - the mind is just activity of the brain. It's the same identity. </p>

<p>Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1852-1934) - Spanish physiologist. He wanted to be an artist, but his father forced him into medicine. In the end, he fused medical training and artistry. One of the first ones to look at neurons under the microscope. He would draw out neurons. At the time, people believed that the whole nervous system were formed from one continous fibre, tangled in a very complex web. He discovered that there were little gaps separating individual neurons. It's not a continous fibre, it's a series of individual cells separated by very small gaps. That means that there might be some sort of communication within a particular neuron. Now you have to communicate across some gap. Idea that you have a nervous system composed of separate cells - <span class="key">neuron doctrine</span>. </p>

<p>Paul Broca (1824-1880) - French Surgon. Examined a patient who suffered a stroke, had a massive speech problem (couldn't produce speech), could only say the syllable "tan." -> <span class="key">Patient Tan</span>. He couldn't produce, but he could take language. Whatever the stroke damaged, it damaged areas responsible of language production. Which means there's a specific spot responsible for this function. Broca did an autopsy and discovered a damaged area - argued that the area (<span class="key">Broca's ARea</span>) was repsonsible for language production. <span class="key">BRoca's Aphasia</span> - if you have damage to Broca's area. Mouth and lip control, auditory cortex to understand language, Angular Gyrus - writing, Wernicke's ARea - if damage, problems with language comprehension, can produce words, it's a word salad (Wernicke's aphasia), hard time comprehending language as well. </p>

<p>Charles Darwin (1809-1882) - English Naturalist. Natural selection. Individuals vary in terms of some traits, there are environmental pressures out there and people with certain traits survive, they pass on their genes to the next generation and their genes get propagated to future generations. Mutations create new traits that could be selecte dfor in new generations. Organisms through this natural selection evolve. </p>
<p>Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911) - Darwin's cousin. English scholar. Argued that intellectual traits - intelligence, morals, personality, were innate/generated by genetics. So they could be things that could be changed by evolution. There are individual differences in these traits and you could measure them. He produced the correlation coefficient - look at which traits were correlated to other traits. One of the first ones to look at regression. Wanted to identify people with these traits. He said it would be bad if people with all the negative traits were to reproduce and have lots of children. It'd be better if we could take people with positive traits and have them breed to make generations of better people - <span class="key">eugenics</span> - selective breeding of the human population. Nazis. Galton was talking about "positive eugenics" - breed people. "Negative eugenics" - steralize people, stop them from reproducing. This was heavily in play in US/Canada leading up to WW2. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 3: May 9, 2018</p>

<p>Grew into <span class="key">Evolutionary Psychology</span> - cognition and the brain is determined by genetics, therefore it's subject to selective pressure. The kinds of cognitive abilities/brain morphology that are functional are going to be passed down generations, and non-functional will not. Focuses onf unctional explanation. Figure out what those functions were. Focus on past functions. "Our ancestors had... that's why we have..." Typically makes comparisons across species - some degree of relatedness - we come from some organism. Steve Pinker - Blank Slate.</p>

<p>What is the current common view on this? Common view is now: monistic view (only one substance, and that it's matter) - materialism (matter, energy, particles and no other substance); identity position (the mind, consciousness is jsut the activity of the brain/tissue); Reductionism (then we should be able to fully explain all of cognitive functionining and consciousness in terms of the material of the brain. Then we can understand memory, conscious perception, etc. Then we can just talk about neural functioning. Reduce consciousness to basic laws of physics, chemistry, etc. Then all of consciousness can be reduced to basic physical properties of the brain which follows a deterministic, causal sequence. Then you become a biological robot.). Although this is a poipular view, it's based on a certain number of assumptions. </p>
<p>Well known philosopher - David Chalmers - Talks about consciousness and its relationship with the brain. Divides the topic into The Easy Problem (trying to discover what conscious states relate to what source of brain activity - correlational claim. Broca's finding, Neglect. He says that determinign what those relations are easy. It's a solvable thing, just takes time, patients.) and The Hard Problem (Why is there consciousness in the first place? Why would it ever even be? That this organ has this conscious experience. How does brain activity become conscious - 3d theatre? We have no solution for that and no solution forthcoming.) He still wants to be a materialist. The way we're gonna solve it: to stay materialist, must assume that consciousness is a fundamental property of matter. Therefore, you can't explain it. That means that all matter is fundamentally conscious. Chair is conscious, but not as conscious as you are. Brain gives rise to a complex consciousness. Chair has a simple consciousness. Everything around us is conscious.</p>

<h1>Cells of Nervous System</h1>
<p>Cells divided into </p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="key">Neurons</span> - transmit electrical signals and are primary determinants of conition and behaviour. Many individual cells separated by small gaps. Neurons are typically on the outside where it looks a little bit mroe gray - <span class="key">Gray matter</span>. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Glia</span> - believed for a long time that they played more of a supportive role, but now discovering that they play a bigger role. There are different types of glia in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. On images, the white area is the glia cells - <span class="key">white matter</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Cerebral cortex has 12-15billion neurons. Cerebellum has 70billion neurons. Spinal cord has 1 billion neurons. Whole brain has ~86billion neurons. 1:1 ratio from non-neurons to neurons. In some parts of the brain, you have way more glial cells than neurons (cerebral cortex), opposite in cerebellum. Lots of cells that create a very complex neural network. </p>	

<h2>The Neuron</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span class="key">Soma</span> - cell body</li>
	<li><span class="key">dendrites</span> - contrusion coming out of soma, they end up receiving neurotransmitters</li>
	<li><span class="key">axom</span> - one protrusion from cell body that carries electrical signal.</li>
	<li><span class="key">axon terminal/terminal button</span> - at end of axon</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different shapes of neurons. <span class="key">Multipolar Neuron</span> - Pyramidal, Purkinje. <span class="key">Bipolar Neuron</span> - cell body with two protrusions - one is an axon, the other is a dendridic stalk with dendritic branches. <span class="key">Unipolar Neurons</span> - cell body and only one stalk coming out of the soma. It biforcates and parts that go dendridic and other that is axon. You can classify neurons by shape and also by their function.</p>
<p>Multipolar neurons are usually <span class="key">motor</span> neurons. Bipolar neurons are often <span class="key">itnterneuron</span> - the connect neurons. Unipolar neurons are often found in the <span class="key">sensory</span> system. A neuron's function is related to its shape. Function and shape typically go together. </p>
<p><span class="key">Afferent</span> means to bring information TO a brain area. <span class="ex">sensory nerves are afferent with regard to the CNS, as they bring information to the CNS.</span> <span class="key">Efferent</span> axons carry information away from the neurons <span class="ex">motor neurons carry away CNS to the muscle</span>. </p>
<p>There are ions, charged particles, that move in and out of an axon - right to the terminal button. Triggers a release of a chemical, the neurotransmitter. Which travels across gap, and attaches to the dendrite of another cell, and that's gonna trigger an eletrial chain within that cell. Ion transfer -> electric charge -> chemical signal -> electrical signal. </p>

<h3>The Soma</h3>
<p>It looks much like any other cell. Within cell, we see a bunch of organelles. Nucleus surrounded by nuclear membrane, which contains the DNA. The nucleolus produces rhibosomes (black dots) - attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rhibosomes create proteins. DNA starts to unzip, gets copied into a messenger, RNA, which leaves nucleus, attaches to rhibosomes, which gets fabricated into a protein. Protein is a building block to your biological system. The Golgi Apparatus packages things into tiny vesicles, a membrane-bound container, which hasnaturotransmitters, proteins, etc. Lysosome has enzymes in it. Golgi Apparatuses package for transport. Neurotransmitters are often packaged inside Vesicles. Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum - makes fats, lipids. The mitochondira - energy production - that area requires a lot of energy. Outside of the cell - a membrane - semipermeable membrane - some things can get in and out, other things cannot. The transport of some molecules is tightly composed. Composed of a phospholipid bilayer - the outsides are water-loving/hydrophilic. The insides are hydrophobic. Extracellular/intracellular fluid. Some things can only move through channels. </p>

<h3>Dendrites</h3>
<p><span class="key">Dendrites</span> - <span class="ex">hippocapal neuron - dendrite has a dendridic shaft, and on the branch are tiny protrusions, the dendritic spines.</span> Dendritic spine has a neck and head. They have proteins that give it structure/form called Actin Filaments. At tip of spine, is the postsynaptic density. Right next to the spine would be another neuron - postsynaptic density. Mitochondria in spine for energy. Post synaptic density has proteins embedded in membrane which are ion channels - with receptors for neurotransmitters - NT will come and attach. Adhesion molecules that connect up to adjacent cell. </p>
<p>Dendritic spines are always dynamically changing. The connections between cells are always morphing and changing. Dynamic system. <span class="key">Spine motility</span>. Down syndrome - too many chromosomes - cognitive impairments, facial morphology, flattening of nasal bridge, etc. 21st chromosome. One of the neural causes: they fail to produce dendritic spines. Spines are important as they increase surface area of dendrites to more connections. Eliminating spines, you can't make as many connections. DS has less connections, less complex cognitive system. </p>

<h3>Axon</h3>
<p>sometines you have a plain axon, other times you have it wrapped by <span class="key">myelin sheaths</span> that come in segments - between segments is the <span class="key">nodes of ranvier</span>. Electrical signal moves down the axon. </p>
<p>Protein complexes that allow ions to move in/out of the cell. They create electric signal that's moving down the axon. Inside the axon has a number of filaments. Actin Filament - narrow, creates structural shape of the cell itself. Neurofilaments - few more protein components, involved in structural support of cell. Muicrotubules - biggest ones, create structural support, and create a highway system within the axon which allows the transport of various types of cargo to the axon terminal from cell body. </p>
<p>Fast Axonal Transport - The cargo/vesicle - big lipid bilayer ball. They're being carried by proteins called motor protein - Kinesen, dynein, myosin Va. Typically one doing the work with the particular cargo. Different motor proteins serve dif functions. </p>
<p>Different motor proteins with dif movements: From soma to terminal, Anterograde Movement, kinesin - carries cargo - starts to untwist, feet, carry the cargo. wound up proteins that unwind.; (If you damage the transport system, it's a real problem cause youc an't get cargo to its destination) REtrograde Movement - from terminal to soma, might be empy veiscles to get them filled up - dynein; myosin va - attaches onto actin filament and cargo and carries it - sideroad - mostly transports to its final destination - into small location, terminal or spine.  </p>

<h3>Axon Terminals</h3>
<p>Hive of activity. Vesicles - some filled with neurotransmitters that are going to be released. We have ion channels for carrying electrical signal down axon, and right at the terminal button. Mitochondira cause you need a lot of energy. Neutrotransmitter - release and communicate with other neutorns. Receptrs for different neurotransmitters - bind an dlead to changes. Transport proteins - brings things you dont need for recycling. Adhesion molecules that are like the one sint he dendridic spine - connect to a particular dendritic spine. </p>
<p>Down the axon, you have axoplasmic transport which moves packages on microtubules. That's very different from the electrical signal being carried by ions thats moving in and out of the cell. Two separate things. </p>

<h3>The Synapse</h3>
<p>The junction between axon terminal and dendritic spine of another clel. There's a space there which is the synapse.  Adhesion molecules connec tiwth each other. They hold them together and control things.Space is the synaptic cleft. Axon terminal before that is the presynaptic terminal. The dendritic spine is the postsynaptic dendrite. Presynaptic/postsynaptic cell. Neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal into the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the PS dendrite. </p>
<p>Very tight, close relation. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 4: May 14, 2018</p>

<h1>Glia</h1>

<p>Neurons - carry electrical signal. Glia - we thought they just had supportive role. </p>

<p>Types of Glia: </p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="key">Astrocytes</span> - star-like cells. A bunch of branches spread out like a star (astro). A number of different functions: form the <span class="key">blood-brain barrier</span> (need a tight barrier betwen blood and brain, must regulate composition of the brain, important cause based on dif concentrations of dif molecules/ions, that'll determine how those neurons function, need to control it tightly, little junctions between capillaries need to be plugged up. Astrocytes have processes and their mtits will plug those holes. BVL = Blood vessels); a nutritioinal role (transferring dif nutrients fromt he blood stream into other glial cells, axons, neurons; gives some structural support - helps create 3D structure of the brain as you dont want it collapsing, keep neurons separate from each other); also have processes that end up isolating various synapses (junction between dendrites and terminals), wraps around that synapse to create an isolated compartment (<span class="key">synaptic isolation</span>); something chemical interaction with the synapse (glutamate) - it takes out a lot of the glutamate, recycle it; when you have presynaptic terminal, postsynaptic dendrite, and astrocyte, you have the <span class="key">tripartite synapse</span>; because a single astrocyte can envelope multiple synapses, it can synchronize the activity of the synapses;<br> The <span class="key">tripartite synapse</span> - yellow is the astrocyte, it envelops and blocks off areas - controlling the chemical composition and the events happening at the synapse. Multiple functions</li>
	<li><span class="key">Oligodendrocytes</span> - in the Central nervous system (brain + spinal cord). (myelinating cell) Multiple processes (legs) that come out, they form the myelin sheaths of the neurons in the CNS. 1 can form multiple units of myelin, and myelinate multiple nruons. The process wraps around the axon (a hand) - it functions like an insulator - allows for electircal signal to be conducted more efficiently. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Schwann Cells</span> - in peripheral nervous system. (myelinating cell)Unipolar - one process, biforcates. EAch unit of myelin is created by 1 schwann cell. Creates multiple layers - wraps around to create insulation. Dif from Oligod - if you were to cut an axon in the CNS, the oligd are gonna create a scar and prevent it from regrowing - permanent damage <span class="ex">spinal injury - can't fix it. </span> We don't know how to trigger it to regrow. Olig releases chemicals to prevent regrowth. If cut Schwann cell in PNS (finger - chop, can resew the finger back on - line up main nerves and then over time create a tubular thing and allow it to reform, regain muscle control).<br>Blood brain barrier implies that theres a dif ecosystem in CNS than PNS - there's a dif immune response. IF you were to get an immune cell in PNS, and plop it in hte brain, it may not recognize cells cause they dont have it.  </li>
	<li><span class="key">Microglia</span> - evenly distributed. 1 function: involved in CNS immune response - trigger the immune function. We've learned now that microglia do a lot more - it can remove neuronal precursors during development (they go around clean things up - through a process <span class="key">phagocytosis</span> - it will bump up against a neural precursor, surround and envelop, take it into itself, decompose it, take components and get it out through bloodstream); can also phagocytose an entire neuron (do it to dead neurons and stressed out neurons - a liability and take it out of the system, within 1 hour); Can remove neutrophils (white blood cell), glioma cells (cancerous glial cells); involved in synaptic development and function (microglial process rubbing up against synaptic cleft, it will rythmically come close to and move away from synapse - unclear exactly what the function is, but they secrete some growth fators that allow the synapse to grow stronger); [Allt hese things are working together - complicated combination of mechanics that make the system work.] <span class="key">Synaptic pruning</span> (enveloping part of synapse, and elminating it through phagosytosis - eliminating the connection. Then that axon may sprout another terminal and connect up to a different part of a dendrite.)</li>
	<li><span class="key">Radial Glia</span> - present heavily during development, especially during early dev. Mostly removed in early adulthood. Most of the cells in our CNS, grow out of a line of cells that line the ventricles (fluid filled sacs within brain). Some of the stem cells divide into radial glia cells that extend to the surface of your cortex. Some of the stem cells (in ventricle) become neurons and some will climb to find their resting place in the cortex. Radial glia provide a scaffolding for these migrating neurons so they can find their ultimate location. You still have some of these in your eye. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Polydendrocytes</span> (NG2 Cells) - lots of processes. They can hang around, if you start to damage oligodendrocytes, they will transform into an oligodendrocyte to remylenate - take the role of th edamaged oligodendrocyte. Certain cells don't just stay as being one type of cell, they chang ethemselves. All cells have the same genetic information. What makes it a partic cell is what segments of the gene are turned on or off. PRotens make it into a particular cell. When tehere's signaling molecules, it can change which genes are expressed and what kind of cell it can become, what it cna do. Stem cells are those that can become anything, depending on their chemical surrounding, the context they're in. ARgument was: once they become a different cell, they are fixed, but not the case for polydendrocytes. Cells are not fixed, they can change. They can also form synapses and carry dendrocytes (not just neurons do this) - can embed themselves and pass through multiple layers of cells, they may be important in coordinating the activity between cells. Pass through a lot of different neurons and electrically synapse with the neurons - breaks the boundary between neurons and glia. </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="key">The Blood-brain barrier</span> - Endothelial cells makes up the cappliary wall, they junctions are tight. And astrocytes plug it up as well. Allows for a lot of control to what gets in or out of the brain. What is allowed to move passively (green) are some gases and a few fat-soluble molecules (vintamin A, d). Other molecules like glucose, hormones, amino acids, and non fat souble vitamins require active transport. There are transporters that get those out of the bloodstream and into the CNS. Astrocytes mediate. IF you break blood-brain barrier (radiation, toxins, cigarettes) <span class="ex">Addiction happens more efficiently if you can shorten the time period between taking drug and shortening time it takes to effect. Nicotine - get it through the blood brain barrier and into brain as fast as you can. Add other things into cig that make it move faster. Some of the toxic chemiclas are designed to help nicotine through the blood brain barrier faster, what you don't want. Other chemicals with flavours - cyanide, tar - all of them end up damaging blood brain barrier. Pharmaceutical companies are battling with this cause they have to figure out how to deliver efficiently to your brain - how to take a ride on these active transporters.</span></p>

<h1>The Action Potential </h1>

<p>Electrical signal going down the neuron. There's an electrical signal that starts at the axon hillock, or first ode of ranvier - travel downt he axon (in one direction) to the terminals. The electrical signal depends on the ions (charged particles0, their concentration inside the axon and outside. Inside: <span class="key">intraceulluar fluid</span>, <span class="key">extra cellular fluid</span> (outside). The difference between inside and outside that creates the energy for electrical signalling. </p>
<p>Sodium (Na+), Chloride (Cl-), Potassium (K+) - electron missing or adding, making them charged particles. </p>
<p>Seawater - high in sodium, chloride, low in potassium - makes salt (NaCl). Extracellular fluid (surrounding neurons in your brain) - very similar to seawater - high sodium, chloride. Intracellular fluid - a lot more potassium than sodium, chloride. This imbalance leads to an electrical difference. </p>
<p>Inside of cell is a lot more negative relative to outside of cell. Voltemeter electrode inside axon: measures -70 millivolts when axon is at rest - this is called the <span class="key">REsting potential</span> - no major electrical activity happening inside the cell. </p>
<p>Outside of cell has a lot of sodium+chloride ions. Inside has more potassium ions. Why is inside negative? NEgatively charged protein molecules inside the cell - so big that they can't get out - they tip the scales so overall, the inside is way more negative than the outside. Ions are the movers and shakers - they move in and out of the cell because inside the membrane are protien channels - closed/open. Every ion has its own channel it can move in and out. Important on channels: they open/close depending on the voltage across the membranes - <span class="key">voltage-dependent channels</span>. Another protein: the <span class="key">sodium-potassium pump</span> that allows sodium/potassium under certain circumstances. Channel is gonna work without energy, pump requires energy to work. Need pump because ions are in the wrong compartment and need to use energy to get them back to the write compartment. [Positive and negative - relative to each other. -70, 0 means they're realtively equally charged. -70 means you're -70 more negative.] </p>
<p>We wanna move ions across to create electrical activity - what drives it are: 1) <span class="key">diffusion</span> - movement of molecule sfrom areas of high concentration to low concentration across a gradient. (drop of colour in water - concentrated and diffuses out); 2) <span class="key">electrostatic force</span> - these are charged particles and like particles repel, opposites attract. "This might be true about love, but we don't know about that." </p>
<p>Potassium is a lot more concentrated on inside of cell - diffusion would want to push it outside the cell. Because potassium is + and the outside of cell is more +, electrostatic force would wanna push it into the cell. Diffusion and Electrostatic force opposing each other. Chloride (blue) - heavily on outside, diffiusion would wanna push it into cell. But because chloride is -, and intercellular is -, electrostatic force would wanna push it out of the cell -> opposing forces. Sodium is more concentrated outside, so diffusion wants to push it into the cell. It's also + and extra cellular is + so it wants to push it into the cell. If you opened the soidum channel, they would rush into the cell - it would change the electrical difference. Sodium has a parimary imabalance occurring. Other thing we'll see with pump - it will pump sd=odium ions back out and exchanging them with potassium ions, pushing them inside. Pump requires energy - it creates the imbalance - pushing more sodium ions outside. </p>
<p>Potassium channel - cell membrane (green). Protein structure. Closed format - not enough physical space to pass ions in and out. Once opened, it unwraps, it opens a physical pore that allows ions to pass through. Channels are voltage activated. What triggers opening and closing of these is the electrical difference. </p>
<p>Soidum potassium pump - helps create electrical gradient. Has mechanism that allows 3 sodium to exit and at the same time, bring 2 potassium inside cell. Exchange mechanism. Requires energy. </p>

<p>What happens if we were to stimulate the system: look at what happens on our voltemeter. Resting potential: -70. WE can electrically near axon hillock and add some positive charge - then if we measure axon, we would see that it became a little less neg on the inside (cause we added positive charge) - this is <span class="key">depolarization</span> - decreasing - making inside and outside a little more similar. If we inject a little mor eneg charge to axon area - would make inside more negative - <span class="key">hyperpolarization</span> - increasing electrical potential across membrane. Each cell has a <span class="key">threshold of excitation</span> - if we put enough of a positive charge in there to depolarize a cell beyond that point, you would trigger a massive electrical change claled the <span class="key">action potential</span> - it hits the threshold, all this activity breaks loose, you get a massive depolarization - called the <span class="key">upstroke</span> - it hits 0, becomes equivalent, then you get an overshoot, the inside a little mor epositive than outside, and it reverses and you get a downstroke, becoms more neg on inside again, get more neg than resting potential (<span class="key">afterhyperpolerazation</span>), then return to resting potential. That's if we're looking at one location on the axon. Peak to the trough - spike height. </p>
<p>What happens to membrane as action potential unfolds. Potassium channels are slightly open. Slow exchange of potassium in resting state. If stimulate, add a bit more positive charge to axon, and brought to threshold, the soidm channels open, a lot of soidum enters the cell, making the inside of the cell less and les sneg, and more and more pos. The sodium channels open because you hit the threshold of excitation - automatic. The potassium channels open as well - potassium leaving the cell (cause gettign mroe and more pos in there) and some sodium entering the cell. Until you hit the +40, peak, the sodium channels will close and potassium keeps exiting the cell - massive downstroke because potassium is leaving. Potassium channels will close (overshoots hits bottom), then some potassium diffuses away from that location and go to other places, brings it back to its resting state. It returns because excess potassium on outside diffuses away. S-P pump comes in, pumping sodium out, potassium in to regain the original balance where theres a lot more sodium on outside and potassium inside. But it's not pump that gets it back to its resting state. </p>
<p>It's the soidum that has both diffusion and electrical gradient forcing it into the cell. It rushes in - potassium wants to get out. </p>
<p>The action potential travels downt he axon. While time is unfolding, <span class="key">absolute refractory period</span> - cannot trigger another action potential. When in hyperpoerized state, it's <span class="key">relative refactory period</span> - you can trigger another action potential, but you need a lot more stimulation. </p>
<p>Not all neurons are the same with their action potentials. </p>
<p>They faollow an all or none law - once you trigger, it's gonna happen. Independent of the intensity of the stimulus. As long as you have stimualtion, you get the same-sized action potential. Not a bigger action potential, you'll just make more action potentials in a shorer period of time - fires faster. Firing rate of neurons. </p>
<p>Can't go back on axon because of refactory period. Regenerate downstream. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 5: May 16, 2018</p>
<p>Propagation of the action potential. Action potential is an electrical signal that travels down the axon. Stimulate the axon, see action potential in A, then B, then C. Continuiusly regenerating the action potential. Remain full size at every location. Propogation occurs in 2 dif ways, depends on whether or not hte axon is mylenated. Some axons do not have any myelin sheaths. Prop occurs through <span class="key">passive conduction</span> in unmyelinated axons and <span class="key">salltitory conduction</span> in myelnated axons. Passive conduction - stimulus, positive charged ions move to the adjacent area, depolarizing it; causes sodium to rush into the cell in the new location; it continues on. It's relatively slow beecause it requires a regeneration of action potential in adjacent regions of the axon. When you have myelin sheaths (salitory conduction - once an axon gets sheathed, it eliminates some of the sodium channels; lots of sodium channels at nodes of ranvier; when you stimulate/depolarize a partic region, sodium rushes into the cell, the positive ions flow all the way to the next node of ranvier; depolarize the region of next node of ranvier, depolerizes and recreates action potential; the action potential jumps from node of ranvier to node of ranvier - a much faster form of conduction; development creates myelin sheaths and speeds up and improves stuff. </p>
<p><span class="key">Multiple sclerosis</span> - an autoimmune disease whereby the immune system attacks the cells in the CNS. What can happen: you can increase the gap between cells that form the blood vessel walls, it allows immune cells, white blood cells to enter the brain - leak through the wall. The oligodendrocyte is quite different - don't recognize oligodendrocyte - it must be a foreign invader - attack those cells. Immune cells attack oligodendrocytes and break them down. Results in demylenation of segments of the axon. Affects white matter in dif locations of the brain - determines the symptoms (weakening of muscles - attack of motor system, visual system - blurry vision, slow decision making). Might develop symptoms, then go into remission, then new symptoms come back. A cycle of increasing symptoms, remission, and getting new symptoms. This is cause the body is able to remylenate some of these axons. NG2 can change into oligodendrocyte to remylenate. Sodium channels were removed from the myelenation so nto enough to propagate action potential. System tries to fix itself by attaching new sodium channels. The brain is learning to compensate for networks affected. First stage - tryna fix itself. Second stage - axons are dying, not enough networks to compensate anymore, symtpoms get worse and worse. A steady downhill. Myelin not used, axon deteriorates. Then you get a retraction bulb - scars over, stuff accumulates. [There are many things in our environment that create an inflammatory response. That inflammation response in preipheral body damages your blood cell walls. Some immune cells wreak havoc in the brain. ] </p>
<p>Key triggers of inflammation of body occurs from the activity in the microbes in the guy. When you eat gluten, it can cause an inflammatory bowel problem - inflammation in the bowels. Most of the wheat we consume has been genetically modification. Changes nature of gluten which out bodies can't tolerate. <Br> You have a health intestine - bacteria that reduces inflammation, resident inflammation, opportunistic pathogens, but it's ok cause you got a lot of good stuff. lllSome nutrients will come up, into the bloodstream, sent out all over your body. T cells - white blood cells that go out and fight off infections. If you mess up the bacterial composition of gut - Disbiosis - lots of opportunistic pathogens - damages the mucus membrane, alloweing some of the bacteria that are supposed to stay in your gut to leave gut and into bloodstream. System needs to attack the bad stuff in the bloodstream - generates immune cells/imnflammatory mediators - they destroy the invaders - you end up hitting your own cells - too much inflammation destroys your own cells. Starts to destroy blood brain barrier and increase the gaps between those cells. Proinflammatory mediators and immune cells entering the brain, they start to think that oligodendrocytes are foreign subjects. And microglia thinking they need to activate their immune response and keep damaging the cells in CNS. Then you end up with MS. What's happening in your gut determines neuro functioning and can trigger a degenerative disease. </p>
<p>Over 90% of seratonin is in your gut. Multiple channels between what's happening in your gut an dwhat's happeniing in your brain. </p>

<h1>The Synapse</h1>
<p>The synapse involves a presynaptic axon terminal and a post-synaptic dendritic spine. They're connected by protein strands - <span class="key">adhesion molecules</span>. The gap is the <span class="key">synaptic cleft</span>. The communicatoin that happens across the cleft occurs through chemicals called <span class="key">neurotransmitters</span>.</p>

<p>NEurotransmitters - different classes of neurotransmitters. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Amines - molecules that are derived from amino acids (basic building blocks of proteins from our diet). Catecholamines (all derive from Phenylalalnine. TRanslates to Tyrosine, translates to Dopa, to Dopamine, changed to norepinephrine, epinephrine. Arrow is an enzymatic step. These 3 are a sequence that derives from Phenylalanin. PKU - huge buildup of Phenylananaline - ensure that no Phenylanalines are in your diet, and supplement for Tyrosine), Idolamines (Tryptophan in your diet goes through a series of stages to make Serotinin and ultimately can end up with Melatonin, also a hormone), Acetylcholine (a byproduct of metabolism - acetyl coenzyme A and choline). The main neurotransmitters in your brain depend on your diet. What you eat will affect your brain chemistry. Diet may be a very important component for mental problems. </li>
	<li>Amino Acids - TAKE IN THROUGH your diet. GABA (major inhibitory neurotransmitter), glutamate - excites neurons, glycine, others</li>
	<li>Peptides - chains of neuroacids - </li>
	<li>Gases - carbon monoxide (it's active in your CNS), nitric oxide (a free radical - NO-. One of the radicals produced during inflammatory response, can dmage your own cells, also a neurotransmitter). Body uses a single thing for multiple things. Might bring one ting to balance and unbalance another. </li>
	<li>Other small molecules - ATP (produced by mithocondhria for energy), Adenosine (byproduct of ATP)</li>
</ul>

<p>Start in the presynpatic axon terminal. A microtubule coming in. You can get vesicles being transported, packaged with neutotransmitters. Axonal Transport. Some other types of neutotransmitters are synthesized and packaged in the axon terminal - empty vesicles. Now you have vesicles filled with NT in the terminal button. Through Translocation, some of those vesicles come up to the cell membrane in a place called the <span class="key">active zone</span> - has a whole bunch of proteins in it (SNARE proteins - will attach to cell membrane and the membrane of the vesicle - both have lipid bilayer membranes -same kind of membrane). This process is Docking, it goes through slight chemical change - Priming - preparing it to be released in the synaptic cleft. Vesicle pools. The vesicles are organized into different pools - active zone has a pool of vesicles that is readily releasable pool - they will release contents into synaptic cleft when the action potential comes and depolarizes. The recycling pool - after releasing, they're empty and get refilled and are ready translocate back to the active zone - active recycling process (5-20%). Vast amount of vesicles that aren't often released - the Reserve pool - call up the reserves (once you blow therough your regular men and women). You're not gonna easily run out of vesicles cause of these reserves. </p>
<p>Voltage dependent sodium, potassium channels. The action potential arrives at the axon terminal, at the end here, when sodium enters the cell, it depolarizes the terminal button region.  And you have calcium ion channels - 2+ charge, so when depolarize, calcium flows into the axon terminal. The calcium comes up to the docked vesicles and leads to Calcium-dependent exocytosis - releases NTs. The cell membrane of vesicle fuses with the cell membrane of the axon terminal, sometimes it fuses a bit, opens a pore and pinches off into a vesicle, other times it fuses completely. The axon terminal gets bigger, but there's a fix to that problem. </p>
<p>The SNARE proteins are involved in mediating the exocytosis (out). Proximal monolayers will start to fuse with one another, they create a fusion stalk; a depression starts to occur as snare proteins pull things apart in the sides, creates a hemifusion ( a depression); create a rip through centre, a pore; then  neurotransmitters will go through this pore. Then it can completely fuse or reverse the process. Snare protein activit y is triggered by thte calcium coming in. </p>
<p>Reverse happens - Endocytosis (in) - a bit of the axon terminal membrane forms a vesicle. Then you have a nurotransmitter uptake, bring sin NT into vesicle and it's ready -> Vesicle Recycling. </p>
<p>In the postsynaptic - you have some ion channels. Some of the ion channels have receptors on them. The receptors are there for connecting to the NTs. NT will attach to ion channel and open the ion channel allowing ions to flow in or out. Sodium in there, then you bring it closer to threshold. Enough positive, depolarization, can trigger an active potential. You're getting an electrical signal  to a chemical signal then attach, allowing ion channels to flow ion in/out. Then electrical changes in postsynaptic cell.</p>
<p>Ligand-Dependent - based on a ligand binding to them - Ligand = NT. It functions on a lock and key type mechanism. Ion channels will have receptors that are a specific lock. Each NT is a dif key. Each NT TYPE will activate a  dif receptor. Lock and key specificity. It's a physical shape of the NT that fits in there. Ion channels opening in a dif way, by a ligand connection. </p>
<p>Not always will sodium flow in - depends on the channel. Typically effects can be categorized as excitatory or inhibitory - EPSP or IPSP. It's a graded change. Brigns you a little closer to threshold and dissipate. Based on ions entering and leaving. Excitatory - increase likelihood of action potential - it's graded - can open a few or a lot of channels - graded depolerization - small or huge. IPSP - graded hyperpolerization, brings neuron away from threshold. </p>
<p>If small, how do you trigger action potential? 1) way: <span class="key">Temporal Summation</span> - rapidly repeatedly stimulating through a given axon. Bit of depolarization starts to fade, but before it fades, add another action potential, and now you depolerizes enough and it triggers. Summing over time rapid action potentials in succession, leading to enough of a depolarization for action potential; 2) <span class="key">Spatial summation</span> - multiple axons - that add over space to depolarize the neuron enough to trigger an action potential. Do it enough to trigger action potential.  </p>
<p><span class="key">Neural Integration</span> - exitatory and inhibitory signals - a bit of depolarization, a bit of hyperpolerization - they sum together is with no change at all. Excitation cancels out the inhibition and vice versa. </p>

<p>A NT comes in and it'll attach to the <span class="key">binding site</span> (lock and key). It causes the ion channel to poen, and now ions can move through. <span class="key">Ionotropic receptor</span> - the receptor site is right on the channel, it's integral to the channel. A ribbon diagram - divided into a series of units  and it goes right through the membrane - they will unwind a bit and increase the size of the space in the middle.  Another type of receptor: <span class="key">Metabotropic Receptor</span> - have a receptor segment/protein in one part of the membrane and the actual ion channel is in a separate location. A protein that's added to the receptor. NT goes to receptor site, triggers the release of some of the units of the G-protein which attach to the IOn channel, causing it to open. NT -> messenger -> ion channel. </p>
<p>Why 2 diff? Ionotropic REceptors are very quick responders and short-lived responses. effects last Less than 10ms. Very, very fast. Metabotropic Receptor - slower and longer lasting - effects last at least 10s. Takes time to go through process, but it's open for longer. IT allows for dif kinds of neurocognitive effects. <span class="ex">For hearing, you need rapid responses - need ionotropic. For other things like regulating your body temperature - that can take a little longer. Or certain kinds of pain, modulating sleep. Those you can have longer lasting effects that occur at dif rates. </span> </p>

<p>Some NTs can have both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors - diff concentrations in dif parts of system. Sodium - excitatory. </p>

<p>Once you get an activation of ion channels, then the NT is detached. It can do a number of dif things: 1) NT is reuptaken by presynaptic terminal - by transporter proteins. Pumps it back in and repackaged into vesicles to get reused; 2) feedback effects - NT connects to another type of receptor called the <span class="key">autoreceptor</span> - it binds and sends a signal to the inside to say that it's enough; 3) deactivation of the NT - done by enzymes which breaks the NT into pieces, gets taken in, reformed, reused; 4) diffusion - just gets diffused away. The astrocyte can actually absorb some of the NTs; What could happen also is Retrograde Transmission - transmitters released out of the postsynaptic dendritic spine - exocytosis, autoreceptor in presynaptic, which signals feedback to stop releasing. </p>

<p>Key principles: You have 3 dif types of NTs, they each activate a particular metabotropic receptor, and each of those can converge on affecting a particular G protein, which can open a potassium channel. Different NTs can have the exact same effect on the exact same channel. </p>
<p><span class="key">Divergence</span> - single thing ends in multiple outcomes. One NT which activates an ionotropic receptor which oepns a chloride channel, and another receptor which activates G proten and potassiumc hannel. Can have 2 dif effects. Gives the brain a lot of flexibility. It all depends on what kind of ion channels. Want a case wehre multiple people can access a single room and a single person access multiple rooms. </p>
<p>Astrocyte has NT transporters and ion channels, receptors for NT - can trigger release NT-like chemicals fromt he glia - gliotransmitters. Interaction with astrocyte is also critical. Multiple things going on. Glutamate is also a fundamental glial transmitter. </p>
<p>Axodendrytic synapse - </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 6: May 22, 2018</p>
<p>[Test] - no diagram given. Short answer - might wanna draw a diagram to help you. </p>

<p><span class="key">Electrotonic Synapses</span> - another exception to the types of synapse. The membranes have protein complexes - one is called a <span class="key">connexin</span> - multiple is <span class="key">connexon</span> - a channel down the middle of it. A bunch of connexons in a membrane of a cell, the membranes of 2 cells line up together which forms a gap junction - ions from inside of one cell can flow directly into the other cell. So closely that you don't need a chemical intermediate step of the neurotransmitter. You can just flow ions from one to the other. Other nutrients can flow through it too. </p>
<p><span class="key">Neuropeptides</span> - amino aicd chains forming proteins/peptides. A form of neurotransmitter. They have other kinds of functions as well. Primarily released from dendrites. Creates an omega complex through exocytosis in dendrite - proteins release into extracellular space. Receptors in many areas - at other dendtires, terminals, etc. A relatively long half life (20min - released, stiill half of it there after 20 mins). NT have half life of 5ms. They spread everywhere and have its effects there. A variety of functions: postsynaptic electrical changes, influence gene transcription inside cells, facilitate the release of other peptides, impact the formation of synapses, have effects on glial cells. Broad effects for a longer period of time. Can change the context of the neural network. Brain can achieve things in multiple different ways - this is one example of that. </p>

<h1>Drugs and Toxins</h1>
<p>Action potential coming down the axon, depolarizing the terminal button. Depolarization triggers release of NTs. Certain drugs block these channels. Prevents action potential from occuring. Prevents electrical signal to be passed down axons. <span class="ex">Local Anaesthetics - sodium channel blockers - Novacain - drug is absorbed, it blocks the sodium channels for your pain receptors, prevents pain receptors from sending out pain signal. Tetrodotoxin - puffer fish - loss of senssation an dmotion - block ssodium channels - stops peripheral functions (heart, lungs, etc.) </span> Indiscriminate - blocks everything. </p>
<p>Prevent NT release <span class="ex">spider - blocks calcium channels</span> Calcium channels is important to trigger the release the NT. ANOTHER type of toxin: <span class="ex">Botulinum Neurotoxins - can grow in improperly canned food. Muscle paralysis, autonomic disturbances (internal organ functioning), droopy eyelids, blurry vision (muscles that control eyes), swallowing problems. Listed as a bioweapon. Could be aerosolized (could be spread through the air). easy to produce. Present in Botox - it immobilizes the functioning at the neuromuscular junctions. Lose ability to control the muscle, inject into muscle, prevent them to be able to frown an dcreate frown lines -> fewer aging lines. "That's why these people have this plastic face appearance"<br>Now used for medical purposes - uncontrolled muscle spacitity - can reduce that.<br> The toxin will butt up against the axon terminal membrane; as endocytosis is unfolding, toxin sneaks in and gets into the new vesicle; it releases a component of the toxin which exits and cuts the snare proteins; it prevents exocytosis as snare proteins are important for docking and etc; reduced NT release - you've paralyzed the muscle. The main NT is acetylcholine that doesn't get released. Can affect central circuits - can hitch a ride on retrograde transport and enter the CNS. Take a ride from the periphery into your brain/spinal cord. Botox effects can last 2-9 months <!--"It's okay to age and to look older."--> </span> </p>

<p>Increase NT release - Goldilock's zone - too little/too much is bad. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Black Widow spider venom - chhemical called latrotoxin - get into the membrane and create pores (holes); allows calcium to flow into the cell; increase NT release; overstimulates the muscle; end up damaging the postsynaptic cell. And you have leakage of NT through some of these pores - so even more NT at the synapse. And calcium is stored away in presynaptic, the latrotoxins stimulates the stored calcium to come out and play. You coould lose a lot of NT stores - you just blow through all of them - lose functionality at synapse, paralysis. </li>
	<li>Amphetamine category (Methamphetamine) - stimulants - increase level of energy, arousal, positive effects on mood. Allow you to work longer, be more positive, etc. The effect: reduces the amount of transmitter that's uptaken into a vesicle, increases secretion out of these vesicles, transporters reverse its functioning -> increase of NT in synaptic cleft, lots of free floaters. Get more excitation because more neural activity. Hitches a ride through transporter and does all these nasty things - spews out all this dopamine.<br>Crystal meth. Germans uses meth to increased nazi productivity - Perbatin over the counter drug. British were using Benzadrin, an amphetamine. Some part of the Second world war was a battle between stimulants. Today, adderall for ADHD - an amphetamine - more energy, concentration, cognitive function. There's a standard now that people fele that to keep up, they need to take a drug. Body is always trying to maintain homeostasis. </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Preventing NT deactivation - enzymes that break down NTs. Acetylcholine broken down by Acetylcholinesterase, Monoamines are breoken down by Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) (primarily in axon terminal). You can have drugs that will prevent the breakdown of these NTs by inhibiting the enzymes.</p>
<ul>
	<li>MAO Inhibiters - inhibit MAOs. Prevents breakdown of monoamines. More monoamines released into synaptic cleft. Increases monoamines at synapse. <span class="ex">Treat depression by increeasing monoamines. One class of antidepressants.</span></li>
	<li>Organophosphates - inhibits Acetylcholinesterase. Used in pesticides. Break down ACE. Overstimulate at synapse. Development for this was for insects - neurotoxic for insects - 25k acetylcholine molecules per second. When you break down ACE, it's a massive accumulation of AC. If humans ingest - muscle weakness, limb pain, trouble breathing cause they all require AC. Now, organophosphates made it into our food cycle - it's on top of your food. Enters the organism plant and is prevalant throughout the plant. You can't just wash it off anymore cause they spray it on the seed. We're consuming it. Flows into water. Contaminates everything. They often hurt insects we find desirable like bees which pollenate. The insects have very similar mechanisms as we do - people are thinking they're all clever to develop this thing they wanna target, but it affects us as well. </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Preventing nT reuptake = block transporters, leaving more NT in the synaptic cleft (can't get rid of it). </p>
<ul>
	<li>Cocaine - stimulant - increases energy, euphoria. Block dopamin, Norepinepherine, serotonin transporters. </li>
	<li>Methylphenidate (Ritalin) - main drugs prescribed for ADHD - exact same effects as cocaine. The reason people prescribe ritalin and not cocaine, it has a slightly slower ramp up time - less addictive. Key: you don't wanna create addiction. <!--"Is caffeine a drug? YEAH, CAFFEINE IS A DRUG."--> </li>
	<li>Some antidepressants - block transporters. Reuptake inhibitors. SSRI - block specifically for serotonin, but none are prefectly specific. </li>
</ul>

<p>Blocking REceptors - prevents effect of NT ont he postsynaptic cell</p>
<ul>
	<li>Antipsychotic drggs- <span class="ex">clozapine blocks serotonin receptors</span> </li>
	<li>African Mamba Venom - blocks muscaroninc aceytylcoline receptors - leads to immobilization.  </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<p>Stimulate REceptors - mimicking the NT. Or receptor molecule might have another binding sight. Falsely stimulate system by the drug.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Nicotine - binds to nicotinic/acetylcholine receptors. After smoking, get a little energetic. System starts to compensate - reduces internal nicotine production - then you need more of the drug. </li>
	<li>Opiates - bind to endorphin receptors (heroin, morphine, oxycodon, fentanyl - 100x more potent than morphine) Reduce pain, anxiety. </li>
	<li>Lysergic Acid diethylamide (LSD) - psychodelic. Binds to serotonin receptors - hallucination. <br>Hallucinogenic drugs - LSD is so similar to serotonin - can compete for receptors and do it for longer. Another type of hallucinogen: <span class="key">Dimenthyltruptamine (DMT)</span> - <!--"This one's interesting. And I'm definitely not saying you should do DMT."--> Breakthrough experience - entering another dimension that feels more real than the present dimension. They interact with entities that sometimes give them advice, oftentimes serpentine in nature. Different people describe the same experienece. You have DMT in your system, but when you take it, you're increasing it. (LSD - everyone has diff experiences). </li>
</ul>
	
<p>Mimicking Retrograde TRansmitters - Justin is all about marijuana, he wants us to take marijuana. Cannabinoid Receptors on presynaptic. REtrograde transmitters - Anandamide and 2-AH released by post-synaptic cell. It inhibits the release of certain NTs, often times glutamate and GABA. Reduces acitivyt at synapse without glutamate. People fele much more relaxed, less motivation. Key ingredient: Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Effects at pain synapses - can be an effective drug for pain relief - esp for some cancers. Less addictive. Not great for recreation use - cumulative effects - lack of motivation, engagement in the world. Long-term effects. </p>

<p>Complex drug effects: multiple effects</p>
<ul>
	<li>Caffeine - increases neural activity, arousal, motor behaviour. 1) has efects on presynaptic receptor in the cortex that's ar eceptor for adenosine A1. Adenosine normally inhibits the release of NT. By blocking it, it ends up reducing inhibition, increasing the release of excitatory NTs. Blocking inhibitor, results in an exitatory effect; 2) Postsynaptic has a Adenosine A2A receptor - when you block the receptor, it increases the affinity of the dopamine receptor to dopamine - increasing effects of dopamine. DNormally opamine attaches, but doesn't open up ion channel enough. Caffeeine blocks, increasing affinity to receptor allowing mroe dopamine to enter. ore post synaptic activity; Doing multiple things. Probably more sites. This is just 2 of them. Individual differences. For most people it's a stimulant. </li>
	<li>MDMA/ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) - eightens arousal, give syou energy, party drug, mood booster. Blocks transporters, increases monamines at synapse, can also reverse transporter, spewing monoamines into cleft. If too much, negative land of ecstasy. Can inhibit MAO, increasing monammines. Inhibit tryptophane hydroxylase, reducing serotonin. Complex effects - dif for dif people. Side effects: inattention, dizziness, confusion, anxiety, can damage serotonin neurons</li>
	<li>Ketamine - reducing depression - esp untreatable cases. multiple effects - blocks NMDA receptors. It is metabolized in HNK and they activate the AMPA receptors, allow more ions to flow into the cell. They have an activating effect on post synaptic cell. Contrary effects on the system, depending on what predominates.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Alcohol</span> - reduce brain activity below the level required for normal functioning - inhibit movement of sodium across the memberane (reduce the action potential), expansion o f the surface of th emembrane (disrupt ion flow and other functions), decreases serotonin activity, enhances GABAa receptor response (main inhibitory NT, so enhancing responsiveness, you increase inhibition, reducing activation), block glutamate receptors (reducing excitation), increase dopamine activity (associated with reward and addiction). Prolonged lifetime use can lead to Vernicke's Encepholopathy - permanent motor/language problems. Preventing self-control -> impulses. </li>
</ul>

<p class="date">Lecture 7: May X, 2018</p>
<p>The effect of the drug depends on the way you take the drug (<span class="key">method of administration</span>) <span class="ex">Smoking cigarettes vs. Chewing Tobacco. Smoking - peaks faster than chewing tobacco. It cna affect the addictiveness of drug. Rapid uptake - system is better able to associate th eeffects with the drug. Intravenous - fastest, stomach takes longer cause it has to pass through things. </span></p>
<p>Tolerance and Withdrawal - ramps up, system metabolizes, goes down. As soon as it enters sytem, tries to compensate by removing heroin-like substances. To try to bring you back to homeostasis. Add up drug effect with system. When heroin drops down and neural adaptation, you go lower and want the drug to fix that.<br> Experienced user - certain environmental cues trigger the start of compensation. Based on those cues, it creates a much larger compensatory response. Actually experiencing a smaller effect - building tolerance. <br> if you take away the drug, the brain prepares to receive the drug, and now you heavily experience the opposite effects of the presence of the drug.<br>You can quit using a drug by minimizing withdrawal symptoms: remove yourself from the cues of drug use. Change the cues and envuronemntal cues won't be there to trigger compensatory response and won't feel withdrawal symptoms as bad. Once you come back, you have to battle a little bit, but the system has already reduced the withdrawal. <br>People have overdoses because they change the context of their drug administration. Cues aren't there to create the compensatory response of an appropriate size, but they're still using the same amount of drug, so they overdose.</p>
<p>Addiction and Reward - a lot of the addictive drugs end up increasing activity in the <span class="key">Nucleus Accumbens</span> <span class="ex">Sexual excitement, gamling, video games, watching attractive people</span>. Things we find rewarding activates the Nuclues Accumbens - a reward network. (gamer widows). <span class="ex">Rat - added electrode at septal area - the rat was in a box and they can press a lever. Every time you press the lever, it would get stimulation or not. If you reduce stimulation, they would stop bar pressing. If you turn on stimulation, they increase bar pressing. <!--"Press, press, press, press. It's shocking!"--> Video games are designed to do - pressing buttons and you get rewards. They get treasured and kill somebody, I don't know why that's a reward. "And you don't even need an ethics protocol to do it. You just need to be a gaming protocol." </span> Activate reward networks that are involved in motivation. Overly motivated to do one thing. </p>

<h1>Neuroanatomy</h1>
<p>Gross aspects of the nervous system and its structures. </p>

<ul>Planes of Section 
	<li>Sagittal - cut the brain from vertical slice. Side view of head</li>
	<li>Horizontal - parellet cut to ground. Looking from the top</li>
	<li>Coronal - side to side cut. From the front. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Rostral(ANterior) - towards front/beak/ in front</li>
	<li>Caudal (Posterior) - towards back/tail/behind </li>
	<li>Dorsal (Superior) - top </li>
	<li>Ventral (Inferior) - bottom</li>
	<li>Medial - middle</li>
	<li>Lateral - outside </li>
</ul>
<p>Frame of reference is the <span class="key">neuraxis</span>. When we refer to some areas, the whole coordinate system turns a bit. But Superior-Inferior are always used as above and below - it doesnt change with th ebend in the neuraxis. </p>

<p>The Nervous System: </p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="key">Central Nervous System</span>: Brain and Spinal Cord. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Peripheral nervous sytem</span> - subdivisions - Somatic Nervous system - controlling muscles, sensory info from periphery; and automonic nervous system - involuntary muscles; ANS subddivides in sympathetic NS (mobilize energy to act) and parasympathetic NS (relaxed and sedentary). And the Anteric NS - intestinal function (not tested). </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Sympathetic NS and Parasympathetic NS - connected to involuntary muscles. SNS is divided into different segments - nerves emanate from th ethoracic and lumbar regions - they will go out and synapse with another nerve which connects to the organ. Before/after synapse is preganglianic. Synapses are a sympathetic chain gnaglion. Arousal functions.<br>PNS - neurons are surrounding the SNS. Comes out of cranal nerves and sacral nerves. Involved in vegetative functions. Preganglianaic neurons are very long. For both, the main NT is acetylcholine. When you get to perophery, the PNS stil uses acetylcholine, but the sympathetic nervous system uses norepinepherine.<br>Opposing forces. <span class="ex">SNS accelerates heartrate, PSNS relaxes it.</span></p>
<p>The Vertebrate NS - Cross section of spinal cord. Areas of grey matter (H, cell bodyz) and white atter surrounding (axon tracks). Follows a <span class="key">Bell-Magendie Law</span> - the dorsal root ganglion is carrying sensory info and the ventral root is carrying motor info (efferent and afferent - motor neuron is efferent relative to CNS). Sensory neurons are located inside of doral root ganglia. Motor neuron cell bodies are in the grey matter. </p>
<p>Circuit - cell body in dosal root gnanglion. Sensory info comes in, synapses to the intrinsic neuron, and another synapse to a motor neuron, sends it out to affect muscle. 3 neuron circuit. <span class="ex">Peteller reflex - hammer knee leg. Only 2 neurons. Sensory directly to a motor neuron.</span> Basic circuits. </p>
<p>The Meninges - layers of tissue that surround the nervous system. Dura mater, arachnoid membrane, subarachnoid space, pia mater, artery going into brain. Layers provide protection around the CNS and cushioning. Inside subarachnoid space is fluid - a water sac to cushion. The fluid carries certain nutrients away. If you're watching one of those crime dramas and somebody says the subject had a blunt force trauma to the head and they died from an epidural hematoma - blood vessels in arachnoid membrane - bleeding between the dura mater and the skull - pool blood at the sac - as it pools, it pushes down on the brain, if big enough, it can put pressure on critical brain areas. Want to drain it as much as possible. <span class="key">Subdural Hematoma</span> - blood boopling between dura meter and arachnoid membrane. </p>
<p>Figure of spinal cord - 3 layers of membrane along the central nervous system. Diagram reversed the orientation of the spinal cord. Looking at the back of the person. Meninges go all the way in the CNS to ensheath.</p>

<ul>Infections
	<li>Meningitis - stiff neck - can't put your chin down to your chest. It's an infection of the meninges. It's swell up there and immobilize the area. Problem: puts pressure on brain. The infection can spread into the brain itself - Encaphalitis</li>
	<li><span class="key">Encephalitis</span> - (white matter is dark, grey matter is white). Damages tissue, pressure on certain places. Could have long-term effects. </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<p>Key components of the ventricular system - Large lateral ventricles. Third ventricle drains through the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle and goes through the central canal in the center of the spinal chord. Cereral spinal fluid is produced within the ventricles by choroid plexus - extract fromb lood, the blood plasma, and pump it into these ventricles. Flows through entire system and gets reabsorbed by flowing through the subarachnoid space, into the bloodstream and heart. What can happen is you can get a block in the system (in many places) -> <span class="key">Obstructive hydrocephalus</span> - babies in utero - ginormous head - water on the brain - have to create a shunt to drain the ventricles into the abdominal cavity. If too large, no space for neurons to grow properly. Skull plates aren't fused yet, so they can enlargen to accomodate. </p>

<p>Blood supply - being provided to the brain. A branching that occurs (anterior cerebral artery in blue, middle cerebral artery in red, posterior cerebral artery in green) on both sides. All of them are joined at the base, the Circle of Willis. Symptom of stroke depends on which artery and how far down the line. Visual problems - very likely posterior cerebral artery. </p>

<p>Main parts of the brain - major divisions (occurs already in utero), associated with different ventricles, subdivisions of major divisions, principle structures per subdivision. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Forebrain - Lateral, Third ventricles</li>
	<li>Midbrain - cerebral aqueduct </li>
	<li>Hindbrain - fourth </li>
</ul>
	
<p>Cerebral Cortex - the outer cortex/bark of the brain with all the convolutions. Does not involve the cerebellum at the bottom. Just the outer area. </p>
<ul>
	<li>White matter </li>
	<li>Grey Matter - surface of cortex </li>
	<li>Fissure - deep grooves</li>
	<li>Gyrus - bumps out or convulutions. Gyrus and Sulci to increase surface area. </li>
	<li>Sulcus - grooves</li>
	<li>Fundus - bototm of groove </li>
	<li>Bank of Sulcus - side of the groove </li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Name areas on how they are demarcated by sulci. Small ones are sulci, deep ones are fissures. </p>
<p>Corticol Layers - One gyri coming up and different layers of cortex. Typically 6 dif layers - always parallel to the surface of the cortex. Fissures and sulci demarcate areas.</p>
<p>Corticol Columns - perpendicular to the surface of the brain. Cellls organized in functional columns. In visual cortex, columns of cells responsible to right eye, and columns of cells responsible to left eye. A columnar organization. </p>
<p>Can divide surface of cortex to serveral lobes - Frontal lobe in front of the Central Sulcus. Lateral Fissure separates temporal lobe from other loves. Behind central sulcus is the parietal lobe. Occipital lobe. Longitudinal fissure that separates the 2 hemisphere. </p>
<p>Wilder Penfield - <span class="key">Corticol Topography</span> - mapping out functions of different brain areas. Open skull, cut through meninges. Wanted to make sure they weren't damaging anything. Stimulate with a light current, dif areas of the brain. Because patient is awake (no pain receptors). Ask the participant what they experience. Stimulating adjacent areas and you get stimulation in adjacent areas on body. Postcentral gyrus - sensations around the body. Sensory homonculus - mapping person on the cortex. Unequal representation of the body. Direct localization of function. Feet are close to the genitals - maybe cause of way baby is in utero. Found the motor homunculus - precentral gyrus. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 8: May 28, 2018</p>
<p>Test 1: Intro, 4.1, 1.1, 1.2,, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, all lecture material up to the end of Neuroanatomy. 45-50 M/C. Several short answer - something ocvered in lectures on a couple slides, in textbook. 5-6 points each. Choice of 2 - answer 1. Full sentences. Diagrams. Practicing Retrieval + over time. One for 4.1 - did not cover. </p>

<p>Major subdivisions of the brain - continue with the cortex</p>
<p>Main sulci and fissures that are landmarks that separete the brain. These separate the main lobes. </p>
<p>Primary cortices - primary sensory/motory cortices - Motor control, sensing touch, pain, etc. Primary visual cortex wraps around midline. </p>
<p>A different way to talk about the parts of the brain - <span class="key">Brodmann's Map</span>. Still a lot of papers that use this nomannature. Looked at the <span class="key">cytoaarchitecture</span> (cell structure). Identified 52 different areas, numerically. (Know the examples). The areas pennfield discovered, they have different cytoarchitecture. </p>

<p>Main lobes: </p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="key">THe frontal lobe</span> - 4 ceparate regions. Primary motor cortex, Premotor Cortex, Supplementary Motor cortex, Prefrontal cortex (actually part of the frontal cortex). Functions: plannning and voluntarily directing movement, speech production (broca's are), executive and emotional control and judgement and decision making (KEY thing, memory. Some of these processes are distributed throughout the brain. When you damage these areas, you get disfunction: disorganized behaviour, inapproproiate behaviour (cant control self), impaired abstract thinking, rigidity of thought, perseveration (hold onto a strategy and continue even if it becomes clearly inappropriate - kkeep doing whats not owrking), personality changes (more reclusive), emotional lability (constant emotional changing). Speicifc type of deficit dpeneds on where in the area you damage. <span class="ex">Phineas Gage and the Frontal Cortex - railroad foreman in the 1840s. 25 yo. Rod went through his head. Thought he was done, starts to get better. PAtient's characteristics years later: fitful, irreverant, indulgent, impatient, eetc that werent there before. </span> This would suggest thatyou would not want to... put something through your frontal lobe. It was seen as a high-level medical practice - frontal lobotomy/luchotomy. Beginnings of a trend of psychosurgery - <span class="ex">A beautiful mind</span> Maybe we could lesion a part of the cortex, and maybe that would solve the problem. Too many connections. Walter Freeman. Various procedures - the one Freeman used: ice pick - lift up eyelid, place ice pick over top the eyeball, pop it in, wiggle it back and forth. <!--"and then you POP! and just wiggle it back and forth. Like basically windshield wipers in there."--> Scoville - temporal lobotomies - cut open and see what he's doing it - didnt like Freeman cause he was goign on blind. Picked a few people from asylum, do surgeries and compare. No solid data. Depression -> you wouldn't care anymore, but also no cpaacity for nay emotional experiences. It wasn't only restricted to patients with schizophrenia. Somebody's daugher was too outgoing, we can fix that! <!--What are we doing today that 30 years from now we'll think are barbaric.--> It became a fashionable trend. One of the most spectacular failures in medical history. Emotional control</li>
	<li><span class="key">The Parietal Lobe</span> - Primary somatosensory cortex. Also involves a lot of integration of sensory information from multiple modalities (all 5 esenses) and internal states (intentions to do something, proprpioception) with external information or goals (for direction eye and hand mvoements). Sensing for the purpose of guiding behaviour; numberical cognition - understanding math; left and right play different roles - damage right = neglect, left = <span class="key">apraxia</span> (disruption in purposeful movement - try to grap water, have trouble aiming for it). Visual-motor. </li>
	<li><span class="key">The Temporal Lobe</span> - WErnicke's Area. <span class="key">Superior temporal lobe</span> - primary and seocndary auditory cortex; Inferior temporal lobe - visual processing (object recognition, high levle perception of objects), damage gives agnosia (inability to recognize objects from visioN) and prosopagnosia (inability to recognize faces); Medial - emotional processing (amygdala), damage - problems with emotion, being able to experience things like fear in rational ways, Kluver Bucy syndrom - Monkeys fail to display fears and anxieties, Memory (hippocampus attached to amygdala)</li>
	<li><span class="key">Occipital Lobe</span> - primary visual cortex - wraps around to lateral outside view. Retinal-topic representation of the external world. Adjacent areas in space activate adjacent cells in the back of your air which activates adjacent cells on cortex. There's a bit of distortion. foveal region - is fixation. Lingual gyrus - up, cuneus - lower. Periphery gets less corticol tissue. You magnify what you're looking at. Fixation area gets more space in my brain. Periphery gets less. </li>
	<li><span class="key">The Limbic Lobe</span> - Cingulate cortex, Parahippocampal guris. Anterior and Posterior cingulate. Connects with all sorts of other limbic structures. Heavily evolved ine motional processing. ACC - emotion and pain-related motor movements, cognitive control, error detection, reward behaviour (do behaviours that you may be rewarded for); PCC - eye movements (where your eyes are fixated), spatial orientation, memory (less understood than ACC); parahippocampal gyrus - memory </li>
	<li><span class="key"></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="key">COrpus Callosum</span> - primary fibre tracks that joins stuff. Involved in interhemispheric transfer of info. Fibres. joining corresponding sections in one hemisphere to the other hemisphere. Image using diffusion tensor imaging. Neatly organized. </p>

<p><span class="key">Basal Glanglia</span> - globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, putamen - heavily involved in motor control. If you damage, you get motor-related deficits - PArkinson's disease (tremors, balance, motor, freezing), Huntington's (jerky movements, genetic), Tourette's (involuntary vocal and facial/movement tics - surgeon who would stop tics).  </p>
<p><span class="key">The Limbic System</span> - broad, general term. A bunch of areas underneath the cortex - emotional processing. Hippocampus, amugdala, oldfactory bulb (just know these 3).  </p>	

<p><span class="key">Thalamus and Hypothalamus</span> - 2 thalamuses (1 on each side) - sensory and motor relay center. Coming up from the spine, relay through this. It's a collection of a whole bunch of nuclei - you can separate them by their function - each do different things. Lateral geniculate nucleus - relays info from eye to visual cortex, Medial geniculate - from aditory pathway to cortex, ventral lateral c(cerebellum to primary motor cortex)> If you have a sttroke near axon, you can damage one of those. </p>
<p><span class="key">Hypothalamus</span> - regulating and controlling hormone release. Through pituitary gland will release hormones. Eating, drinking, sexual behaviour/drive, other motivated behaviours. Body temperature. <span class="ex">Oxytosin and vasopressin - generated in hypoth, move to posterior pituitary and released into the bloodstream.</span> Stress hormones. Regulatory-type behaviours. Basic homeostatic systems. </p>

<p>Midbrain - Tectum and Tementum</p>
<p>Tectum - bumps - top is superior colluculus (visual stuff), below is inferior colliculus (auditory perception). </p>
<p>Tegmentum - a whole bunch of nuceliu. Substantia Nigra - lots of dopaminergic neurons - movement behaviours. Red Nucleus - connects motor nerves in spinal cord to cerebellum. </p>
<p><span class="key">Reticular Formation</span> - tracks. Part of red nucleus is in reticular formation. Descending portion control motor areas of spinal cord and connecs to cerebellum. Ascending portion influences arousal and attention - active when you're ready for action. Goes through brain stem.</p>

<p>Hindbrain - </p>
<p><span class="key">Cerebellum</span> - Use to think fine motor control, but it deals with a lot. Sham rage - feel rage but no stimulus. Active when people are doing tasks - almsot everything we do. Yet we know very little about it. <br><span class="key">Agenesis of the cerebellum</span> - or the connecting tissue to the cerebellum, not a major cognitive deficitt and medium motor control deficit, beyond that, they can function like anybody else. Can be missing the entire region that is involved in a lot of things and still be able to do it. Possible that it was cause they were BORN without a cerebellum - compensation. </p>
<p><span class="key">Pons</span> - joins cortex. Locus coeruleus - arousing the system. Cochlear nucleus (audition), vestibular nucleus ( vestibular function), raphe nuclei (sleep and arousal), superior olive (info from ears, sound localizatio). Basic functionality hapening in brain stem. <span class="key">Medulla Oblongata</span> - control over reflexes, respiration, vomiting, salivation, heart rate - die without it. Inferior olive - cerebellar motor function. </p>
<p>Cranial Nerves - differnet carnial nerves that come out of the brain stem. different places that they go. Know the name of the different nerves that emerge from here and what they're responsible for. Know that the optic nerves, olfactory nerve. Glossopharyngela nerve for taste, throat, larynx, hypoglossal for tongue movement, vagus for internal. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 9: May 30, 2018</p>
<p>4 slides this class on test. </p>
<ul>3 types of systems
	<li><span class="key">Cholinergic Systems</span> - neurons localized into a set of systems. In green have acetyylcholine - cholernergic for Ach. Locted in the basal forebrain, and parts of the pons, and midbrain. They project to the limbic system and neocortex. Learning and memory functions. Degenerated in Alzheimer's disease. 2 different kinds of receptors: Nicootinic and Muscarinic (named after Amanita msuscaria mushroom).</li>
	<li><span class="key">Dopaminergic System</span> - Ventral tegmental area gives rise too two pathwayys: mesolimbic (to limbic ysytem) and mesocortical (to frontal lobes) pathway. Also connection to the nucleus accumbems. Reward, planning, etc. Certain reward structures will trigger dopamine activity in the system, which makes you feel like you wanna engage with the stimulus a little more. <span class="ex">Hearts and likes in social media - working with the understanding of these systems. Busness model is to hold your attention, by addicting you with rewards</span>Nigrostriatal system - motor. </li>
	<li>Noraderenergic Systems - norepinephrine (noradrenaline). From the Locus Coeruleus - projecting to most places in the brain. It's like your arousal dial - high levels of norepinepherine will get your aroused, low levels, you'll feel sleepy. Multiple types of receptors. Stress response will involve the scretion of norepinepherine. </li>
	<li>The Serotonergic System - serotonin - projected from Raphe nuclei throughout brainstem. Projected to spinal cord, cerebellum, limbic system, cerebral cortex. REsponsible for mood, sleep, appetite. Multiple types of receptors. </li>
</ul>
<p>End of Test 1 </p>

<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>Groups of methods that do different things. </p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Determine different structures of the brain. </p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="key">Light Miscropopy</span> - slice of brain tissue, take a look at different strctures of the cell. To get thin slices, you harden the brain by putting it in formalin, wash and perfuse out any blood so it doesn't go bad, put it in microtome machine that cuts the brain into thin slices. Once you have a thin slice - most of brain tissue is transparent - use different types of stains (dye) so parts of tissue will grab onto dye more than others - gives you contrast. <span class="ex">Nissl Stain - highlight cell bodies; Myelin Stain - highlgihts axon bundles - myelin segments; Golgi Stain - highlight all parts of the neuron. That Ramon y Cajal used to draw picturs of neurons. </span> </li>
	<li><span class="key">electron microscopy</span> - several techniques: <span class="key">Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)</span> - thin slice of tissue, shoot electrons through the tissue (some absorbed, some pass through), gets an image; <span class="key">Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)</span> - take block of tissue, laser off a clean edge, shoot electron gun at the face of tissue, some electrons get excited and bounce back, some absorbed, get emitted electrons from tissue that captures - get more 3D type structures. What they use now to get really detailed images of what's going inside the cell. </li>
	<li>Computer Axial Tomography (CAT Scan) - structures in an in-tact brain. Shooting an X-ray source. Absorbed by certain tissues, less ddense will allow it to pass through and a detector on the other side - you get an image. You can enhance the contrast in some ways. <span class="ex">Cancer - see a lot more blood vessels connected to tumour. Contrast agent in blood - will see tumour clearly. </span> Xray source and detector rotate around the body, you get a 3D image. Only to measure the structures of the brain. Resolution not that great. And X-rays will damage tissue. <!--If you have it done, ask if they saw any tumours.--> </li>
	<li><span class="key">MAgnetic REsonance Imaging (MRI)</span> - very strong magnet, places body inside magnetic field. Metallic tattoos. Can heat up metal with electric current. The atoms in your body have paramagnetic properties. Hydrogen has an axis of rotation - magnetic field will align these axis of rotations. They emit a radio pulse frequency to excite that particular atom - hits the atom, excites it, shoots it out of alignment, as it goes back into alignment,it releases radio frequency - you detect this. Diffferent tissies have different Hydrogen atom densities. Full 3D view of your brain. 3D map of Voxels (3d pixels/cubes). You can look at it all. Resolution increases with the strength of the magnet. Stronger magnets will also pick up artifacts. <!--"And it'll rip the inside of your eyeball"-->  YOu don't have to measure H atoms, you can measure others.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)</span> - mRI to specifically measure axon bundles. Whit ematter has water that moves parallel to the axon bundles. You can measure moving water. Different colours show which direction the axons are going. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Lesion</h2>
<p>Look at functions of the brain, not just structure. Lesioning often done on animals. A damage made to a nervous system to ascertain the function of the lesion area. Looking for what deficit emerged after the lesion was made. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Aspiration - sucking out tissue </li>
	<li>Knife cut - cut tracks. disconnects</li>
	<li>High frequency radio pulse - insert electrodes that burns/damage areas </li>
	<li>Excitotoxic Lesion - insert a very tiny needle in and inject chemicals that stimualtes the area so much that it creates the excitotixic lesion - so much activaty, glutamates accumulate (toxic), positive ions (damage mitochondira), </li>
	<li>Chemical Lesions </li>
	<li>Reversible lesions - put a device in, bottom is exposed with cooling agents and cools the area of the tip. SLow down metabolic activity in the area. Temporary lesion - turn off, warms back up, functions again. </li>
</ul>
<p>Device typically used: <span class="key">Stereotaxic DEvice</span> - to figure out where you wanna go, use a BRain atlas. The bregma - landmark to move in the xy plane - cross of coronal and saggital. Guides you where you want to go. Take animal out and it would do its task. </p>
<p>Always want a control condition in these studies. Anesthesia -> Incision -> Lesion -> Sutures. Problem: if animal does task and behaves differently, it could be because it was anesthetized, had skin cut open, and it's sore from surgery. Want to ensure that you have the right explanations. Control group goes through the same procedures, but there's no damaging lesion. If differences - then it's specific to the lesion. </p>

<p>How do we create lesions in humans? </p>
<p><span class="key">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)</span> - strong magnetic pulse to scramble neural activity. Localize the area using MRI. Use device with a figure 8 current - disrupts the magnetic field of neurons under the skull - disrupts action potentials. Put it over the right spot - do for short period of time and it will knock out the function. Repeated TMS - can be used to treat depression and hallucinations - overexcite certain areas and cause circuits to rewire a bit. </p>

<h2>Recording Brain Activity</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="key">Single-Cell Recording</span> - insert a microelectrode with a fine tip, can make contact with a single cell/neuron. Attach plate to skull, which holds electrode. Craniotomy - where you make hole. Measures electrical activity/current. Can figure out what the specific cell is responding to as the animal moves around. Neurons that fire to specific images. Animal cna move around. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Multi-Cell Recording</span> - arrays of a bunch of electrocdes - open up a hole in skull, remove, implant. Implant whole thing and more likely to hit a neuron of interest. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Electroencephalogram (EEG)</span> - in humans. Electrcal activity from the surface of the scalp. Apply gel. Neurons that are firing inside of skull are creating a signal measurable outside of your skull. Axons are in columns. Benefit: high temporal precision - measuring in milliseconds. Hard to know where it's coming form, to localize it - spatial resolution is poor. Event-related Potentials (ERP) - Electrode caps. Electro montage. Channels. You can timelog when you measured the signal, locked to some event. Timelog it to an event - Event-related potentials. Measure brain activity, show a face, the person views it, show other things,. Take snippets of when you show face and average them together. Able to separate out noise to figure out the signal specific to that face. Specific activity of face unfolds over time. P300 - consciousness, attention. What each peak and wave means. Can get more precise with</li>
	<li>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) - measuring hte magnetic fields associated with electrosignals in the brain. They're less absorbed the scalp so you can pick them up. You need a whoel bunch of magnetic coils used as sensors in a cap. In a squid array - super conducting quantum interface device. Havet o cool the system. Very expensive. Each coil functions as an electrode, picking up magnetic activity. Can superimpose on MRI machine to get an idea where the signals are coming from. Better than ERP, but more expensive.</li>
	<li>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) - whole bunch of detectors that detect decay of radioactive isotopes. Inject radioactive substance in bloodstream. Get them to do a task - blood willl go to region associated with task. Starts to decay. As it's decaying, it'll emit ppositrons. When they collide with electron, they emit 2 rays ind if directions. Sensors pick up where they hit and calculate the location from which it was sent. Can map out function of where the brain is being active. Radioactive versions of neurotransmitters. Trace all sorts of things. Problem: you need a way to create radioactive substances cause they decay quickly. Very expensive. Don't have good temporal resolution. <span class="ex">Visual task - occipital lobe. Listening task - temporal areas. Problem Solving - frontal area. </span></li>
	<li><span class="key">functional Magnetic Resonance imaging (fMRI)</span> - what brain areas are actually active in a given moment. You're measuring blood oxygenation levels. Areas of the brain that are active are gonna require more blood flow. Then you can infer where it's active. A proxy for neural activity. Not directly measuring neural activity. Measuring bloodflow changes in regions of the brain and assuming when you create bloodflow, there's more activity. Measuring oxyhemoglobin relative to deoxyhemoglobin. DeoxyHb is paramagnetic. Basal state - normal. Amount of blood supply outweights the amount of oxygen being used. Oversupplies the blood. Decreased relative concentration of deoxyHb. Deoxyhb has less effect ons ignal coming form that area. Increase in signal you cna measure - less deoxyhb to disrupt signal. Can look at the BOLD response - areas that are active in the brain require more bloodflow. You can see which areas are receiving more blood and can infer what's active. fMRI, even though very commonly used to measure brain activity, actually measures bloodflow - you're inferring - it's a reasonable assumption - indirect.<br>Ways of doing an expirement - 
	<ul>
		<li>block technique - for some time, you present the stimulus, then you stop it, do it for a block of trials, and you keep collecting BOLD response images, block of rest or control condition and the only dif between stimulus and rest should be the factor you're interested in (colour vs. no colour). The BOLD signal is a little delayed - ramp up and drop off. Then you compare stimulation moments and the bold signal during control/rest moments</li>
		<li>Event-related technqiue - shorter events you're interested in and randomly intersperese with rest. Use sophisticated computational deconvulving technqiues to figure out what part of the bold pattern is associated with stimulation/rest. A set of functional images for stimlation and a set for rest/control. Take the average activation of stimulation and subtract from that the average during rest. Colour as activation heat maps - red/yellow are areas that are very different between the two. OVerlay on top of a standard MRI image. First get anatomical image using standard MRI, then do experiment, then do another anatomical image to see if head moved - if you moved, can't map it directly. Standard subtraction technique. You're comparing all of those voxels. Use statistical techniques to control for false positives - replicate to confirm. Doable, not as expensive as PET so used a lot.</li>

<ul>Stimulation Techniques
	<li><span class="key">DEep-Brain Stimulation</span> - person has to have some sort of problem/deficit that warrants this. IT's very invasive. <span class="ex">2 electrodes impanted into the nucleus accumbens - major depression - could not be treated with anything. The current being applied through electrodes - when stimulation is on, the person shows a massive relief (deeply depressed -> normal immediately) Depression ratings change as dial changes. When turned off, depression goes back up. Turned on, depression goes down. Problem: need to have it on, stimulating, to see the effects. But even some moments of reprieve is nice. Can stimulate basal ganglia area - dopaminegic system - Parkinson's. Have device attached and self-stimulate.</span>  It's a therapeutic technique, but you can learn something from it too. Stimulating nucleus accumbens can get rid of depression. </li> 
	<li><span class="key">Optogenics</span> - you don't need to go into the brain to stimulate the brain. Using light to control the opening and closing of specific ion channels. Light-gated channels - based on frequency of light, electromagnetic. You can take those genes and insert themin living animals. Genes from algae. Put it in embryo and it'll get expressed in the animal. Can put them in the form of a virus and inject it and replicate the gene and also proteins. Or inject the gene into the cell. When cell gets genetic code, it'll transcribe to protein. Different protein channels are sensitive to different kinds of light. Channelrhodopsins - light in the blue wave lenth and allows positive nurons in. Halorhodopsins - repsonsive to yellow light, allows calcium to come in - inhibitory - hyperpolarizes neurons. Rhodopsin-GPCR - G protein receptor. Harvest these genetics from organism, clone them, and insert them into animals and they'll produce these channels. You can control brain activity with light. You can actually do mind control/brain control with light, that's where we are in 2018. Can control person's personality with light. Also good for poepl ewith depression, etc. Can control the firing rate.<br>Problem with electrical stimulation - you need to get electrode through tissue and the tip will touch multiple neurons. With optogenetics, you can target a specific cell. Cell-specific activation/inhibition. Can examine/control synapse functions. Work at any level. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)</span> - apply electrodes (spongy, bigger) that distribute the current over the scalp - stimulate from one electrode to the other and influence neural activity. Weak current. Anodal stimulation - positive electrodes over critical area increases firing rates - a lot more activation under that area. Cathodal stimulation - decrease in firing. Can reduce motor fatigue by applying anodal stimulation over motor area. For stroke patients - improve performance by applying amodal stimulation over damaged area. You can influence people's reported mind wandering. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Patients</h2>
<p>Never wanna rely on single cases. Typically, when people have brain damage, multiple areas are damaged so hard to know what's responsible for what.</p>
<p>Study by Karnath and Colleagues - studying pathients with neglect. Collected a lot of patients - 140. Looked at their damaged areas - created overlay plots. Patients who had right brain damage and who also showed signs of neglect. Took other patients with right damage who did not have neglect. A composite map of neglect vs controll - subtracted difference. Then found yellow areas associated with neglect. Isolate specific areas of damage - need a lot of participants. </p>
<p>another trick with patients: <span class="key">Double dissociation</span> - if I'm interested in seeing whether 2 processes are separate or independent of each other, strong evidence comes where I can find a patient 1 who has process A impaired, but process B unimpaired (single dissociation). Stronger evidence coems when you find Patient 2 with process A is unimpaired and process B is impaired (single dissociation between prcess A and B, but opposite). This is a double dissociation. It suggests that process A and B are independent, separate processes. YOu can damage one without damaging the other. <span class="ex">Language comprehension and language production. Some patients with damage to Broca's Area that impair production but leave comprehension. Other patients who have damage to Wernicke's area who have comprehension impaired and not production. </span> </p>
<p>Different sptial/temporal resolution for some of the recording techniques. ERP has much better temporal res than fMRI and PET. But fMRI can have better spatial res than ERP. Depending on whawt you want to measure, you would choose the best one. Always changing cause always getting more powerful and better. </p>
	
<h1>Neurodevelopment </h1>
<p>What happens with the nervous tissue when you have an embryo early in development. </p>
<p>A series of stages: Conception to adulthood. Faded - ramp up and die down. </p>
<p>Right after conception - 18 day embryo. Lots of cells multiplying. Slice through embryo - 3 layers of tissue: Ectoderm - skin, nails, etc.; MEsoderm - blood vessels, muscle, bpne; Endoerm - digestive, respirtory system; Within the ectoderm, there's a development of a neural plate - called <span class="key">neural induciton</span> - these cells are the cells that give rise to the nervous system later on (Neural plate cells). All of the cells in the ectoderm initially could become neurons - but they're inhibited and they become expressed as outer layer of your body. You suppress all other regions from becoming neurons.<br>Changes in neural plate - <span class="key">Neurulation</span> - it folds slitely, creates neural groove with folds, folds in on itself until you have the neural tube - center is the Central canal which contains the cerebrospinal fluid in the end (now just amniotic fluids). All nervous dissue comes from neural tube. </p>
<p>From chick embryo - neurulation - live tissue images. </p>
<p>Drawings of changges. Happening in the course of days. Neural plate folds in on itself. Anterior neuropore and posterior neuroopore close up. Over the course of 4 days. </p>
<p>Embryo at 7 weeks - already seein gthe human being here, beautifully being formed. All major divisions are already present at 7 weeks. <!--"Looks like an alien."-->  </p>

<p>Proliferation and Neurogenesis - over weeks after conception. Coronal view - major area - the ventricular zone - contains all the neuralepithelial cells (stem cells that will become the neural tissue within the brain).</p>
<p>Start with NE cells (stem cells), divide and replicat ethemselves - symmetric prolif division - just making more. One will divide into neuro and a radial glial cell - assymetric neurogenic division. <!--I can't get too excited cause I'll move nad then I'll be in pain.--> The radial glial turns into a neuron. A Glia cell will now split into a neuron and another radial glial cell. and RG cell will split into 2 neurons. RG will extend to create a scaffolding formv entricular zone to other parts of the cortex - a lot of them change into neurons. The cells have the same genetics - it's what you turn on and off - that's what determines what kind of cell it is. You wanna squeeze the most out of NE. You can add an imediary cell (BP - basal progenitors) - which splits into 2 neurons. Then you get a lot more neurons comign from a single NE. Neurogeneic division - when at least one is a neuron. BP coming depends on dif times in devleopment. There is continued Neurogenesis cause NE in adulthood. PLasticity does occur, even though not as much as during devleopment. Want to know how to fix itself more. </p>
<p>Gotz - most of neurons in the brain are derived either directly/indirectly from radial glial cells. How do you know the dif between radial glia and neurons? Look at markers - neurons have certain kinds of proteins, glial have certain proteins - are they present? That assumes you know what proteins are specific to which cell. Inferential, imprecise haze. This is not rocket science, it's neuroscience. </p>
<p>Proliferation - refers to increasing the number of cells. Prliferative - increasing number of NE cells. Neurogenic - make the neurons. Differentiative. </p>

<p>Migration - get them to the right location. 1) Somal Translcation - early in cortex formation - ventricular zone and surface of cortex - neuron sends out a long process to the surface of the process and the nucleus starts to move htrough the cytoplasm and nucleus follows it through cytoplasm and cell body movs there - dont need the radial glia; 2) Glia-guided migration - radial glia sending process to surface - neurons migraitng to the layer they belong; (1,2 perpendicular to cortex) 3) Tangential Migration - going tangentially to radial glia. Processes sent out - tips are called growth cones. Grow out and follow a gradient of chemicals - chemotropic cues. Brain has concentrationgradients of chemicals. Processes follow these chemical cues. The centrosome migrates up the cytoplasm, dragging the nucleus behind it. And the process that's in an rea of higher concentration is gonna survive while the other is retracted. You get another growth cone forming in the area of the high cues. Keeps following. Stretch out, body follows, stretch out, body follows, and so on. Key: following chemical gradients. Growth cones are very sensitive to them.  </p>
<p>The cortex is getting thicker as cells are migrating - forming the key corticla layers. (dont memorize layers) Know that ventricular zone is right next to ventricle and subventricular zone is next to that - where all the clel division is happening - next to vnetricle. From E30 to 55, get a few changes. Happening ove rthe course of days. If you assaulted the system during this time, chemically, you can do major brain damage caus eyou wouldn't allow this process to unfold - why you have to be careful with what moms consume - there's a placental barrier cause baby's circulatory system is separate - but nutrients have to go through barrier - cettain chemicals can go through and effect the baby. "I was thinking I'd get buckled on the floor now. I have a secret brace. Don't make me laugh, it hurts." </p>


<p>During differentiation is when the neuron starts to take on its very specific characteristics it has. Several things have to happen - need dendritic tree formed and the axon connected up to the right place. </p>
<p>Dendritic arborization - dendrite forms and becomes more complex. Starts out simple and gets more complex. Dendritic branch length increases. The other thing that has to happen: axon has to grow and get to the right location. TIps of the axons have growth cones - they're formed by actin filaments. Protude into fingerlike protrusions called fliopodium. Groves in here (lamellipoddia) - very sensitive to chemical type cues. They wlll follow chemical gradients and guided to particular locations. Repelled by certain chemicals and attraacted by certain chemicals and makes it way through the cells. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 11: June 11, 2018</p>

<p>Growth cones guides its way. Very sensative to various chemicals. Attached to cells, you have chrmical cues - <span class="key">adhesive substrate-bound cues</span> - they attract the growth cone, they guide them along. You also have repellent substrate-bound cues -repel the growth cones. chemical cues floating in between the cells - repulsive which push growth cones away and attractive that pull growth cones. Growht cones follwo specific chemicals - how it finds its way to its targe tlocaiton. </p>
<p>Roger Sperry and The Newt - Studied a series of newts - optic tectum (visual cortex), the left eye connects directly to the right tectum. Key feature: if you were to cut the optic track, it will regrow. Whereas human tracts don't regrow. He took the eye which is sending axons to the tectum (inversion/reversal), he transsected the optic nerves. The newt would momentarily lose vision in that particular eye. He also rotated the eye 180 degrees. What would happen to the axons as they regrow - would they go to their old locations or folow some rule? They would grow to the same locations as before - something about the locations that they still found their way to that location. It saw everything upside down. It didn't get fixed, continued to be confused. Why does it find its way to the old location? It's all about these chemotropic cues. </p>
<p>REtina has topography dorsoventral which is high in concentration in the dorsoal quadrant and low in ventral quadrant. In tectum you have high in ventral, and low in dorsal. So the neurons in high concentration in dorsal will find the tectum location with high concentration. Same with Antherior/Posterior with topography anteriorposterior. Something about their chemistry distinguishes them which guides it ot the location. </p>

<p>Once axonf inds its way to chemical locations. As the growth cone approaches, it starts to shape into the terminal button. As it's doing that, the post synaptic membrane starts to get receptors with a lot more vesivles piling in. Growing into a mature neuron and synapse. This happens throughout development. Throughout and into late adulthood - always forming synapses, but much lower rate when older.</p>

<p>Next step: myelination. Around birth. 1Development of organizational tracts. Oligodendrocytes are forming the myelin. WAnt to start in spinal cord first because that's where you want stuff happening. Last is frontal lobe - not fully myelinated until 18-21 - explains why teens have lapses of judgement. (young people tend to not care about making errors - could be related to this). <!--"So Some of you might have something to look forward to, getting more myelin."-->  </p>

<p>Final stage: synaptic pruning and apoptosis. </p>
<p><span class="key">Apoptosis</span> - preprogrammed neural death. Some neurons ultimately will be killed off. First, you make way mor eneuron than the brain neeeds - overproduces neurons and synapses. Then it cuts them back as th eorganism is engaging in the world. The brain realizes that there are some neurons that I don't need. <span class="key">Neurotrophins</span> promote the survival and activity of neurons. Muscles release Nerve Growht Factor - tells the neuron to continue to live, get stronger. Cells that are not used don't get exposed to neurotropins trigger the cell death process. </p>
<p>Massive decline is apoptosis - when the baby is bigger, responding to environment around it, then it plateaus off. </p>
<p><span class="key">Synaptic Pruning</span> - useless connections trimmed back. Depends on the brain area. This is jus ttrimming synapses, not killing neurons. Might chop off branches. Some people refer to it as Neural Darwinism - overproduce, and select the best ones.</p>

<h1>Critical Periods</h1>
<p>critical periods that emerge during developmental stages. Brain is very sensitive to assault (viral, chemical). </p>

<p><span class="key">FEtal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD)</span> (chemical assault) - alcohool go through placental barrier and affect fetus. It's a neural inhibitor. It could reduce the amount of firing of the neurons in a developing fetus - reduces NGF, and early cell death and the brain doesn't develop as much. You get tall-tale physical features - narrowing of eyes, no groove abvoe upper lip, thin upper lip. All depends on how much alcohol. Cognitive deficits - poor executive control (frontal lobe), attentional deficits, impaired learning, memory. </p>
<p>Smaller brains than control participants. Areas that are most affected - inferior parietal area (a major reduction). Brain abnormalities all over the place. </p>
<p>CDC: sex and alcohol don't mix well. No known safe level of alcohol during pregnancy. Regular medications, even ibuprofen, can affect the fetus (fetus can get more feminine traits). Generally: stay away from all chemicals when pregnant. FASD occurs on a continuum </p>

<p><!--"Here we have a mouse, within a mouse. That's a baby mouse. Within the momma mouse."--> While this mouse is pregnant, the mouse's diet, levle of stress, physical infection are gonna influence the millieu of the mother, as a result it can influence the biochemical makeup of the placenta. The maternal stress can infect the biochemical makeup of the placenta. Can make male fetuses more feminine, female fetuses more masculine. Environmental exposures can also affect the germ cells of the fetus and the genes that are expressed in the fetus. The female fetus already has the eggs - it also affects the eggs/germ line, soi it affects another generation down - <span class="key">transgenerational epigenetics</span>. Changes that can manifest several generations down the line. If the father is stressed out, there's actually epigenetic changes to sperm cells which can have transgenerational effects.<br>The gene centric view is not correect - you're not just passing on the genes, you're passing on a cell. Those cells have all the machinery to read the genetic code - what matters is genes AND what genes you're turning on. Imagine you have an instruction manual - what matters is what parts you read. Imagine skipping a chapter. The turning off and on of the genome is affected by things all around us. </p>
<p>Prolonged stress. <!--Imagine your context, I mean, you're stressed out for 4 years. You wanna be low stress when you wanna... get things going. Just chill out, it's okay. --> </p>

<p>also during development, environmental richnes sis also a big player. Studies with animals: put animals in enriched condition (toys, running wheels) and a control/standard condition (cage). Way more neural development occurs in enriched scenarios. Greater spine density. Early in development, wanna make sure organism is exposed to enriched conditions. Most of these studies, the standard condition is by themselves, in a cage, with nothing to do. Enriched condition is when around some other animals, has some running wheels, and could run around the lab. Standard condition is more of a deprived condition. Showing the negative condition. They just put rats in cages and said that's normal, but that's not normal! Giving them more stimulation might not actually have a benefit, the worry is deprivation. When people raised in normal situations, adding more things might not help. One worries that you're trianing them to be constantly stimulated - that might be diagnosed as ADHD or somehting. </p>

<h1>Plasticity in the Adult Brain</h1>
<p>Evidence that there are new neurons that are forming, even in adulthood. Involve hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Ventricular zones - lining of ventricles - where a lot o fcell prliferation/neurogensis occurs ind evelopment and adulthood. Some in the striatum - might be some evidence of neural growth later in adulthood.</p>
<p>In the Dentate Gyrus of the Hippocampus - Type 1 Radial Stem Cells - glial cells but have the capacity as stem cells to reproduce and become something else. Type 2 non-radial stem cells become immature neurons, and placed into dif layers of the dentate gyrus. This is happening in adulthood. </p>
<p>700 new neurons per day. continual turnover in hippocampus. </p>
<p>In subventricular zone - Type A, B, C cells. Type B cells are astrocytes - they can regenerate themselves or change to type C cells, proliferative precursors. C can differentiate into neurons. They come from astrocytes in adulthood. In mammals, migrate from ventricle to olfactory bulb because olfactory cells are always turning over fast. </p>
<p>Corpus stratum - not sure. Maybe coming from SVZ. </p>

<p>How can I facilitate the creation of new neurons in my adult brain? You can increase neurogenesis. </p>
<p><span class="key">BDNF (Brain Drive Neurotropin Factor)</span> - special molecule/factor that's heavily involve din triggering neural growth. BDNF is transported in the anterograde fashion and released from the synapse and moved in the retrograde fashion, released and affects the presynaptic terminal of other cells. Going both ends. When it makes contact, it upregulates the production of proteins to make cells healthier and produce. Have BDNF being released. Once they bind to post synaptic cell, cna increased receptor activity. It's doing things all over the place. This seems to be what leads to neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Goal is to upregulate BDNF. Key factors is physical exercise. Way more BDNF mRNA in the exercise group than sedentary group. Depends on how much exercise you get - more distance run, the more BDNF produced. </p>
<p>In humans, exercise has been associated in improved executive control, improved various control control processes, spatial abilities, cognitive speed. People exercising are cognitively healthier. Prominent in older adulthood. <!--Otherwise you're gonna get coginitive slowing and you're gonna hurt your back.--></p>
<p>Another way: through dietary restriction. We tend to overeat. Shocking. This is a negative stressor on our bodies. If you have dietary restriction, you can increased BDNF. Ad-libitum - whenever you want vs. REstricted scheudle. </p>
<p>whole lot of benefits: increases neurotrophins (stimulate growth); increases antioxidants; increases removal of damaged molecules; increases beneficial ketones; reduces inflammation; reduces oxidative stress (huge generation of free radicals when you eat a lot of food)</p>
<p>why does it work? Both exercise and dietary restriction provide a good level of stress that put the system on alert and make it work more efficiently. Whereas overeating gives you a bad level of stress, too much load on the system that's ultimately not good for you. </p>
<p>Endurant exercise and intermittent fasting can have a number of benefits. Independent of what you're eating. </p>
<p>Different regimes - Time Restricted Feeding - all your eating in 8 hours. Increases the amount of time without food - mild stressor - let's clean up, get ready. <!--"I've tried this. It's great."--> Caloric restriction - reduce number of calories, eat less. Intermittent Energy Restiricion - do it on some days and not others. 5:2 diet - 5 days regular, 2 days restrict. Alternate day fasting: day 1, the next day you just don't eat at all. Alternate day restriction - eat day 1, day 2 is restrictive. IER probably has the best effect - switching it up. <!--"I experiment on myself a lot."--> It works, but loses its effects. Keep system off balance, make it try to adjust, right level of readiness. Trigger neural growth in adult brain. </p>

<p>Nutrition - lots of individual differences - waht you need at what time. Rats: LFCC diet vs. HSFRS diet. Low fat, complex carb rats had way more BDNF production. What you eat also matters. HFS is not good for your brain. Eat natural food that grows in the world, and is not made in a factory/laboratory. If it has more than 3 ingredients, don't buy it. Go to Tim Hortons and ask them for th eingredients for the muffins. You will never eat a muffin again. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 12: June 13, 2018</p>
<p>Test average: 73% </p>
<p>The effects of learning and experience on brain plasticity throughout life. The expreriences that we have continually modify our brains. <span class="ex">String players - people playing violin. Looked at their cortex. Compare somatosensory cortex to control - physical shift in th elocation and strength of response increased. Depended on the age on when they started to learn. Greatest strenght of activity in the cortex were those that started early in life. changing your brain. </span> <span class="ex">Squirrel monkeys - manual taks where they have o retrieve a food pellet. Post-training - a lot more brain matter devoted to the fingers (red). 12 days of training only for plastic changes. </span> <span class="ex"> People who were learning how to juggle. Grey matter changes in certain areas of cortex. Left P I sulcus (hand eye coordination) getting bigger. Mid-temporal area (perceiving motion) - more.  </span>  <span class="ex">Brain size changes for keyboard players (15 months). Grey matter size (size of cortical area). Increased area in right precentral gyrus (motor control), corpus callosum (coordinate between hands), right heschl's gyrus.</span> Whenever we learn, we're actually changing something physiologically in our brain. The strength of the synapses between neurons. Getting more dendritic branching, more connections forming, incporaritng new neurons. </p>

<h1>Plasticity After Brain Damage</h1>
<p>Many different ways for brain damage: </p>
<ul>
	<li>tumors (meningioma - tumor in the meninges) - even if it stays local, it cna start to push on the brain</li>
	<li>infections (encaphalitis)</li>
	<li>toxins (alcohol)</li>
	<li>degenerative diseases (parkinson's, alzheimers)</li>
	<li>strokes</li>
	<li>traumatic brain injury</li>
</ul>


<p><span class="key">TRaumatic brian injury</span> - trauma to the head. <span class="ex">fall off bike, hit with ball</span>. Areas of maximal damage: where you made contact with the damage, the <span class="key">coup</span> (right under) and on the other side (<span class="key">contre coup</span>). In the motion, you get a lot of tissue shearing/cutting. Cutting axons, fibres, and small blood vessels. Very common in sports. You only need one bad conscussion to have lasting affects. Cognitive change,s memeory/attention deficits, some motor deficits with recurrent concussions. Takes one concussion = problems, more conscussions = many more problems. Strongly associated with depression. </p>
<p>Brain 70 hrs after TBI. ventricles are being compressed and difficult to see. Don't see any gyri and sulci as if they were filled in - cortex is swelling up so no grooves to see. Get small multiple hemmorheges - light colours. 6 hours later, must've damaged a slightly larger blood vessel - hematoma - pool of blood in the tissue - deform the brain tissue around it, pushing it. </p>
<p>Important to get repeated scans. </p>

<p><span class="key">Stroke - Cerebrovascular Accident</span> - 2 kinds: </p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="key">Ischemic Stroke</span> - a substance (buildup form inside of artery) gets peeled off, floats down arteries, as artery gets smaller, then it doesn't fit, gets stuck, physically blocks blood flow. That deprives neurons of important nutrition (particularly oxygen. need continous oxygen supply. No other source.). The neurons around the ischemic region (region not recieivng oxygen) start dying off. You get swellign both brain tissue (cells) and because plasma is being released out of blood vessels - trying to send immune responses from the blood - starts to fill the interstitial tissue area - creates more of an edema/inflammation - fluid fillign spaces around cells</li>
	<li> <span class="key">Hemorrhagic stroke</span> - knick or tear in artery - causes blood to go into brain tissue. Dying neurons and swelling/edema. Surounding areas, cells can survive. Tend to be deadly.; But most strokes are Ischemic strokes which can be treated - might fix themselves, blood pressure pushes the blockage.</li>
</ul>
	

<p>Hemorrhagic core - from BTI which ruptured arteries. Bloodpooling. 36 hours later, see dark space around - brain edema starting to take hold. Swelling - IN PNS, trying to get white blood cells and immune markers into the affected area. The artery becomes more porous. A way to get the immune system focused on the area. In joints, immobilization. In the brain, it's not helping you. </p>
<p><span class="key">Cytotoxic Edema</span> - Why do the neyrons die, and why do you ge tthe swelling? <!-- "I worked really hard on this schematic. So I hope this helps you guys." --> ; </p>
<ol>
	<li>GCutting off the blood - insufficient nutrients. Then you can't produce enough energy, which leads the sodium potasium pumps to start to fail. Can't make ATP. "This is the mitochondria here, it looks like batman." When SP pump fails...</li>
	<li>accumulation of sodium in the cells - depolarizing the cell</li>
	<li>eleads to an increased of release of glutamate (Exitatory NT) - more glutamate going into synapse</li>
	<li>getting more activity at the synapse. You have this beautiful astrocyte involved - it pulls out glutamate with transporters. It's also starving for energy and working hard to get rid of glutamate - they get overwhelmed and failed, and now are spitting out of transporters.</li>
	<li>Way more activation of glutamate receptors. A lot more sodium getting into post-synaptic cell.</li>
	<li>NMDA receptor is a glutamate receptor - when you get a lot of the postsynaptic depolarizaiton, calcium flows in. Getting a lot of positive charges accumulating</li>
	<li>they damage mitohondira leading to less ATP.</li>
	<li>that leads more sidiump pumsp to fail; This positive cycle of positive activity, overactivity, breaks down everything.</li>
	<li>when mitochondira starts to fail, it starts to release free radicals. They give off electron and damage tissue. Invader coming in, you wanna kill. But there is no invader so starts killing its own cells. Damages all otheorganelles.</li>
	<li>increase of positive charges create an osmotic pressure, which drives fluid outside into the clel, causing the cell to swell - <span class="key">Cytotoxic Eddema</span>. swelling itself disturbs the cell membrane and it could make it mroe permeable (spacing between phosphloipid bilayer). Distrupt ion channels, protien channels, everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what happens when you have a cytotixc effect - becaus eyou get overactivity. </p>

<p>Can use this to create lesions. Happens within minutes. </p>
<p>Once you have one stroke, it's more likely you'll have a 2nd stroke. Cause the things peeling off, you wanna go on a blood thinner. 8 hours later, 2nd stroke which could've been prevented. </p>

<p>Cytotiic edema happens in other strokes too. Hemmorhagic - arteries will start to tighten up, provide less blood. Proper way of delivering blood is cut off. </p>

<p>Hemorrhagic stroke: Additional things happening during stroke: Blood pouring out, flooding region with blood.</p>
<ol>
	<li>blood comiing out, starts to pool, causes pressure on the membrane of the cells, disrupts ion transfer- > buildup of ion cells</li>
	<li>constriction of the blood vesesels nearby, reduce the blood supply, causing ischemia (ischmic like stroke)</li>
	<li>cytotixic damage and cytotoxic edema, caused by icnreased in cation concentraitons (overactivity)</li>
	<li>When you get a bleed like this, want to coagulate the blood and create a patch, Thrombin released by cells that try to block it up to prevent more bleeding (good response)</li>
	<li>but thrombin has other efects: makes NMDA receptor more responsive to glutamate (more cations flowing into the cell), increasing excitiotoxicity. Helpful and hurtful at the same tiem (like free radicals).</li>
	<li>thrombin actiavates microglia to release proinflammatory markers cause lots of stuff in your blood, immune system wants to kick in to try to take care of those potential invaders flowing into the brain, but these pinflammatory markers further damage the cells within the brain</li>
	<li>the blood contains hemoglobin and the heme is made of iron, when blood flows in, enzymes will break fown hemoglobin and creates free radicals, which attack the tissue in the brain</li>
	<li>increase of plasma flow into the brain (vasogenic edema) - spacing between cells will allow it in to try to help, but it flows in and fills the space with fluid which causes pressure on the cells. Starts damaging ion channels. </li>
</ol>
<p>All cells including glial cells are getting hit hard. All cells will die. </p>

<p>What could you do to halt this process? Open negative ion channels, provide ATP, drain the blood, engage inhibitory system. Inhibit glutamate receptors - reduce cycle of toxicity, block sodium/calcium channels. Hard to find things that target the speicfic area that don't have massive negative side effects to the rest of the brain. Main thing: break down the clot. </p>

<p>Macro level - hours and days after stroke. Main area of damage, surrounding area called <span class="key">Penumbra</span> of struggling cells. Goal is to save as much of penumbra as you can. Likely cells at focal damage will die. First, neurons are connecting up to the penubra neuron which may be about to dye off - you have a denervation here - removed this synapse. Dendrites/synapses grow when there's activity, die when no activity. Starts to atrophy - spines to collapse. You get deecreased activity of this neuron. Some axons that are damaged are scarred over, and there's an inhibition of axon growth. 1-4 weeks after the stroke, a bunch of recovery mechanisms coming into play. </p>
<p>Some neurons ynapsing with the dendrite, might start to create collateral sprouts (new sproud from end of axon) that makes an axonal connection with the dendrite. The dendirtic spine remodels. System also starts to up regulate grown molecules to strengthen the newly formed synapses  and happening at the axon terminals. You get more potential for excitatiory connections being made. And downregulate inhibiotry GABA receptor activity. Right at the time of the damag,e damage caused by overactivity. HOwver, later on, in the ealry times of surviving tissue is underactive, which is a problem. Initially, overactivity, then underactivity. Then brain increases activity to save them (FALLING ASLEEP). TEMPORAL sequence to things. </p>
<p>Then the networks will start to remodel - network/modeling/reorganization. Took a mouse/rat and created an ischemic stroke. REd region - responsive to hindlimb and green region responsive to forelimb. Caused a lesion. Wiped out a big part of sFL region. Some neurons dying off, spine collapse, reduced neural acitbity. And there emerges some cells that now become repsonsive to both limbs. Then as time goes by, increased activiation and remodeling. Ambidextrous neurons. Some sHL are now resposnive to other things. You get a remodeling. More tissue that's responsive to both limbs - reduced sensory specifificty. 4-8 weeks after, more sensory specificity. Now regained function. This is referred to as spontaneous recovery - brain doing it on its own. </p>
<p>The remodeling can be long distance. Damage to left subcortical motor pathway - you increase connectivity after the stroke between ipsilesional motor areas and contralesional motor areas. Simultaneiously decrease cnnectivity in thalamus and contralesional. You're getting changes in connectivity across the hemispheres. </p>
<p>One thing that also happens: <span class="key">Diaschisis</span> - reduced activity in distant areas from the area of primary damage. Different kinds: 1) <span class="key">Connectional diaschisis</span> - red arrows - reduced connectivity, green - increased connectivity; 2) functional diaschisis - some areas more active, some areas will become less active afteerwards. </p>
<p>What if you get some areas taking over other brain areas. Amputations - amputated limb but might still feel that the limb is there. Worse: might feel pain in that limb. Like a muscle tightening. Initially, would assume that it was caused by the terminal end of axon - then cut the limb further. But people would still experience <span class="key">Phantom Limb</span>. Some of it is due to cortical reorganizaiton after the reamutation. You got a sensory area no longer eceiving input. Might get collateral sprouting from adjacent areas into the vacant areas. Adjacent to the arm is the face/lips. So people who have phantom limb might trigger because of stimulation to their face/lips. People with phatom limb - when you touch this face, tou also see activation in the limb reagion. Activation spreads over. Due to collateral sprouting. Legs next to genitals - They would feel an orgasm in the amputated leg. And they liked it. </p>
<p>Face touch could connect to leg pain receptor. Ramachandran Mirror Box. </p>

<p>Reorganization with a bit too much learning. Musicisnas cramp - lose dexterity/control in their fingers. Turns out that it's <span class="key">focal hand dystonia</span> - because person is practicing so much, each finger wants more tissue - the neurons responding to one finger will try to grab neurons from other finger - you get an overlap of the regions responsive to the fingers. You lose discrimination of the sense of touch of the motor system - leads to this clumsy fingering. It's hard to undo - case of overlearning. Musicians typically don't come back from that. Central problem, not peripheral. </p>

<p>After damage: cell genesis - neurogensis that creates both neurons and glia. Some areas after damage are fixed because new cells are being put in their place. </p>
<p>Ca get new neurons or cna travel along blood vessels.</p>

<p class="date">Lecture 13: June 18, 2018</p>
<p>Finish off last few slides on brain damage. Ways that we can minimize the impact of the damage that comes along with strokes, closed head injuries, etc that disrupt the brain tissue.</p>
<p>As the damag eis unfolding, the tissue and penumbra is caused by overexcitation. AS time progresses, it becomes underactive and damage continue s because of underactive. Early on, you wanna reduce overactivity - blocking glutamate synapses or open potassium channels. Idea: make drugs that can do this. But there aren't really any drugs that seem to do the job without having worse side effects. </p>
<p>Indication that Cannabanoids work - controversy. Cannabanoids have antioxidant effects - stopping the overoxidation. </p>
<p>Maybe Omega-3 fatty acids might help - strengthening the cell membranes. </p>
<p>Right now, the main treatment for ischemic stroke: tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) - dissolves clot to improve blood flow. You have to administer within 3 hours, very quickly. May improve chances of recoverin from a stroke. </p>

<p>Within early months, brain spontaneously fixes itelf. Some reorganization. Partly occurs cause edema goes down. Also get recovery of those brain networks. You can engage in training and continue to improve into the range of 1 year after stroke - starting to modify some brain networks. </p>

<p>Study with rodents: created an ischemic stroke over motor cortex controlling one of the paws. Divided the animals into several groups. 1) lesion + enriched environment (running wheels, platforms, social interaction, reach m&amp;ms with arm; 2) standard, caged; 3) sham condition - went through all same procedures + enrihched. The performance improvement was greater in the enriched group than the standard group. REceiving training improved neural growth and performance. Sham and Ischemic groups didn't show much difference. This happened in the undamaged motor cortex - filling in, taking on some more function. </p>

<p>Cortical Stimulation - in humans, apply tDCS over and around the ipsilesional motor cortex (same side as lesion) - you can improve motor function of the affected limb.; You can go to the contralesional cortex - can disrupt activity to improve performance in the affected limb - rTMS or cathodal tDCS. The unaffected contralateral motor cortex will start to take over a little bit. By inhibiting the contralateral, you disinhibit the ipsilesional to regain function. Reduce temporarily in th eunaffected hemisphere. </p>

<p>What people are starting to find: you can use stem cells and translant them into the effected region. They will start to change into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. Repopulate a damaged area with damaged cells. Different places to get stem cells - patient's bone marrow, fetal tissue (implanting genetics of another organism and don't know the implications) </p>

<p>We don't have many good ways to help recovery after brain damage. Prevent head injury and stroke (reduce stress, eat healthy). Low stress, low antiinflammatory diet. Avoid foods that trigger inflammation. And of courtse, don't play football.</p>

<p>Different sensory systems</p>
<h1>Vision</h1>

<p>Vision is the sense we know most about. Point of our sense - take info in world, detect, analyze, so system understands and can respond correctly to the stimulus. </p>

<p>Vision is <span class="key">electromagnetic energy</span> - Eyes are only sensitive to a small part of it - the visible spectrum. PAckets of energy or waves. Waves: wavelength roughly corresponds to the colour you experience. There's a lot of information - colour, texture, space, distance, info about objects far away. </p>
<p>The stimulus enters the eye and processed within the eye and processed within other parts of the brain. Light comes in, hits cornea, through anterior chamber, hole (pupil), then hits lens - just transparent cells attached by a series of muscles - can squeeze or stretch out - focus light at diff distances, goes through vitreous chamber, to retina which sees the energy and transforms it into a neural signal. Blood vessels and axons of nerves leave out of the optic disk. White part - sclera. </p>
<p>Goal for light to get refracted by cornea, lens and focus it on the fovea that's dense with photo receptors. </p>
<p><span class="key">Myopia</span> (near sightedness) - eye is elongated. Light focuses in front of the fovea. By the time it gets the image, it's a little blurry. Can only see things clearly up close. <span class="key">Hyperopia</span> (far sightedness - eye is squished. focusing point is behind the eye - might be able to see tings far away, but close up you need glasses; <br>Part of the world where 90% of young people are myopic - theory: bookwork/nearwork theory. Buried on books/devices - very close - eye as it's developing, doesn't develop properly. Evidence that it's also determined by the amount of light you receive as a child affects the growth. If you're spending a lot of time in dimmer conditions, your eyes are not gonna develop properly. </p>

<p>Dan's Retina - darker in the fovea cause dense. Optic disk. Blood vessels going into optic disk. Info falling in onto optic disk  is never gonna be processed - a blindspot. Area of space where your're not getting info. It falls on a dif spot on each eye so you can compensate. Important you have continous blood supply to retina. <span class="key">REtinal detachment</span> - retina peels off the back of eye and loses some of its blood supply (to determine if baby has been shaken - brain has whacked around, retinal detachment). PArt of your visual field will seem off - shifted because physically your retina is shifting. Not getting same correspondence. Contact opthamologist immediately to reattach your retina. Suck out some vitruous, air bubble and then reinflate eye. Can never align perfectly, but brain compensates. </p>
<p>Wiring diagram of the retina - pigment epithelium; next to that is the rods and cones - pinner and outer layer; outer plexiform layer where rods and cones connect to bipolar cells which connect up in the iinner pleiform layer with gnaglion cells which send their axons down, out the optic disc, make the connections they need to send info to the brain; Horizontal direction: connecting cones/rods are horizontal cells; Processes for dif ganglion cells - amacrine cells; Also have a muller cell which stretches down. </p>
<p>Photoreceptors - Rods and Cones. 120m Rods - abundant in periphery of eye. Good at responding to faint light and motion signals. Not sensitive to colour. Want to use when dusk sets in. Mostly in the periphery; Cones (blue) - most abundant in the foveal region. Need a lot of light to have them be functional. Sensitive to colour vision. When evening comes, you lose colour vision cause not enough light energy to activate the cones effectively enough. Relying heavily on rod type activity. If dim, better to look a little bit to the side cause that region will fall in periphery which has more rods which is sensitive under low levels of illumination. Plopping fovea on there, it's gonna hit the cones which aren't that effective. </p>
<p>Foveal vision - lots of cones; In fovea, only a few receptors send input to each postsynaptic cell. A lot of fine detail information; Need bright lights; many cones - good colour vision; </p>
<p>Periphery - lots of rods or only rods; Many rods that converge onto a bipolar cell - data reduction. only have one cell representing the are corresponding to all the rods. Much coarser representation. Less detail; Faint light; few cones - poor colour vision</p>

<p>Subjective conscious experience doesn't seem to match physiology. </p>

<p>Physiology of retina - photoreceptors that capture light start to transduce it - light has to pass through all of this info before it gets there. That means our retinas are wired backwards. All these cells are quite translucent. Light hits discs where the chemical reactions occur. the bottom purple part - turning over cause damaged fast. Need to regrow. Need access to massive blood supply. They will also heat up a lot (photons) so blood supply creates a heat sink so it can continue to have blood movement diappate the heat quickly. </p>

<p>Within a rod - <span class="key">Transduction</span> - take light energy and translate to neurochemical signal. Requires chemicals called <span class="key">Photopigments</span>.<br>What happens in the dark: discs contain molecules that contain rhodopsin which consists of retinal and opsin bound together. It's in a form called 11-cis form. Photoreceptor cells produce cGMP which attaches to sodium channels, oening channels, allowing sodium to move into cell. This depolarizes the cell and you release Glutamate. This glutamate release and depolarization is a graded depolarization. Not like an action potential which is all or none. The amount you release will depend on the amount of light. While rod is in the dark, it's releasing glutamate - dark current.; <br> What happens in the light: light photon hits the retinal and change it into the all-trans form. TRiggers an enzyme to be released that breaks down cGMP. There is less cGMP to open up the sodium channel which closes and you get hyperpolarization. You get less release of glutamate. Adding light reduces the activity/release of glutamate from the rod. </p>

<p>The <span class="key">Muller Cell</span> - light coms in at top, gotta make its way to get to photoreceptors. Muller cells are radial glial cells in the retina. They are there in adulthood. Most in brain will retract or turn into neurons. Exception: the retina. Connect up with rods and cones. They function like optical fibres. Capture the light and funnel it down to the rod and the cone with very little light scattering. They funnel things so it gets you perfectly to where you wanna go. Bypass other cells. Fovea also has a parting of the cells for a direct access. </p>

<p>How we code for subjective exprienence</p>

<p>Colour - Helmholtz proposed Trichromatic Theory of colour vision - there might be 3 dif kinds of cone receptors, each sensitive to a dif range of wave of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is the case. Sense depnding on the relative activation of the cones. Doesn't account for all aspects of colour vision. <span class="ex">Colour afterimages - even though white, you see colour there. Theory can't explain that. </span> Can use tricrhomatic theory to understand some of diftypes of colour blindness. Red green colour blindness - "Is there anybody who doesn't see a number in there. Oh good, I was worried someobody was gonna learn" Ishihara plate - multiple reds and greens of dif intensities. Can't tell dif on red and green based on intensity. Have to rely on colour of hue. Dif types of this. See things in shades of yellow and blue. No green opsins in green cones to detect.<br><span class="key">Trianopia</span> - rare. Lack cones in blue range. Perceive most in red/green. Theory is partly true but doesnt give complete explanation. </p>

<p>Another theory: <span class="key">opponent process theory</span> - perceive colour in terms of opposing pairs: red/green, yellow/blue. Might be bipolar cells that wire this way - 1 will turn on/off. Look at green area, it might get fatigued out so when you look at white, you're not getting activity from green, but only the opposite colour -red. Bopolar cell will inhibit. Getting both red and green but no longer responding to green. </p>
<p>Another kinds of problems with theory - we know about phenomenons like <span class="key">Color constancy</span>. If I have a red apple, it will look red to me regardless of what red I illuminate with it. Might be reflecting a dif wavelength, it will still look red to me. Don't want objects to keep changing colour. Problematic to other theories - color isnt tied to a specific wavelength.</p>
<p>Propose Retinex Theory - colour composed by various info to determine colour. An interpretation rather than an inherint property of an object. Property that you create with your mind. A little wave length of light, but your brain does a lot of work to interpret it. What you see is an interpretion. Colour is a psychological construct. <!-- "Would that with the dress phenomenon?" "Since you asked. He was not a plant." Flumbr or tumblr or flipper. "Me and my friends...ok."  -->Same wavelengths but dif experiences. "Wait, what?" Experience depending on the surrounding context. Backgroudn tells you about the illumination - bluish light vs whitish light. System takes that into account when trying to compute the colour. Dif peolple's visual systems make dif assumptions about the visual illumination. More/less warm light or more/less bluish light. </p>
<p>Empircal theory of colour vision - it depends on your prior learning. Colour that you experience depends on your prior experience with objects under different types of illumination. As you're growing, the visual system grows up this repretoire to make inferences. Your conscious experience of the colour you think out there is a fabrication/construction of your mind. What's coming from the object are just a series of wavelength. When you experience your colour, you consciously experience as though it's there in space. But it's not, it's being created by your mind. But you experience it as being out here in space. You are consciously projecting a highly detailed, fully coloured hologram out into 3d space fromy our mind. No rays coming out. Conscious experience is something you're generating. Holographially putting it out there in space. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 14: June 20, 2018</p>
<p>Receptor field - part of visual field that excites or inhibits field. Does something to or changes the activity of the cell. Each receptor is very small - each part corresponds to a point of the external field. Light activates a receptor. Series of receptors connected to bipolar cells whciich all connect up to a single gnaglion cell - the receptive field of this ganglion field corresponds to the summation of the receptors. Multiple points activate multiple receptors, but converge a single ganglion cell - making it cover a large field.</p>
<p>A whole lot of receptors in the middle and in the surround. All of these receptors converge onto a bipolar cell. Horizontal cell makes it so the receptors in the center will turn the bipolar cells on - on0center/off-surround system. <!--"This is actually an exercise in focus attention. Jeremy's gonna go beat them up."--> An on-center, off-center surround + a ganglion cell. Horizontal and bipolar cells only have graded potentials. Ganglion cell is gonna have action potential.<br>Illuminate just the center, get a depolarization in biolar cell and incrnease firing in the ganglion cell. If you have a donut shaped light (surround), lead to a hyperpolarization, stop firing the ganglion cell. If entire thing, a bit of a depolarization and a moderte increase in action potentials. If inhibited firing, rebound effect and wills tart firing a lot<br>Right side: opposite - off-center, on-surround. A lot of the overlapping receptive fields tiling the entire retina/visual field. (last diagram wrong probrably in the lines drawing). </p>

<p>Ganglion Cells - sending their axons to the visual centers in the brain. We have a whole bunch of dif ganglion cells. 1) Monostratified - dendrites in just one segment in the retina. ; 2) Bistratified - dendrites into two different layers; Vary in size, which colours in retina. Most common: Midget, Parasol, Bistratified (large, small) - 90% of ganglion cells. Each sensitive to slightly different types of information. Different kinds of ganglion cells already processing info in parallel diff aspects of the visual field. </p>
<p>Parasol (M Cells - connect to Magnocellular layer in LGN) - responds to large low-contrast objects and movement. Heavily distributed in the periphery in your retina. Very large cells sicne responding to large objects. Large receptive field because need to respond to larger objects and for motion, you need soem space to detect motion. </p>
<p>Midget (P Cells - Parvocellular) - the most common. Motionless objects, and colour (specifically red-green) </p>
<p>Bistratified (K Cells - Koniocellular layer) - info about colour (blue-yellow), detail</p>
<p>Separating what kind of information you're processsing in the ganglion cell level. That info sent up into the brain. </p>

<p>Once they send downaxon, through optic chiasm. 1 pathway: takes info to superior colliculus (10% of axons go there) - control eye and head movement. In the brainstem; 2) geniculastriate pathway - info from both visual fields, go through optic nerve, crossover in optic chiasm, right visual field ends up on left side etc, first connection made at lateral geniculate neucleus of the thalamus(DLGN). Cells from thalamus send theri projections all the way back to primary visual cortex. Geniculate to striate cortex. Main pathway for vision.</p>


<p>V1 - striate cortex. Connec tup to dif layers in the LGN. Parvo has 4 dif layers. Konio has blue layers. Magno has 2 yellow layers. Each send on axons to distinct areas in the V1. </p>

<p>Literal geniculate nucleus how it gets parvo magno and knion info. On one side of the LGN, it's getting from contralateral eye and ipsilateral eye input. Getting info from both sides. Eyes maintain separation all the way to primary visual cortex. </p>
<p>Ocular dominance columns for each eye. Info from right eye is coming into one column of cells, info from left eye into a dif column of cells. Columns of cells that are responsive to specific visual features. Orientation columns that are responsive to horizontal line features. You have feature-detectors in primary visual cortex. Very clean spearable organization of information. Spatio-topic organism - 2 areas close together in visual field are gonna activate nearby cells in retina and will activate nearby/adjacent cells in cortex. REproduced in retina multiple times depending on ganglion cells. Then reproducing that map in the visual cortex. Foveal region takes more of the cortex. </p>
<p>In these cells, we see a center-surround receptor field. Hubel and Weisel. Accidetntly discovered that visual system is responsive to edges/bars differently. Simple cells, complex cells, end-stopped cells.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Simple cells: on area, off area. REceptive field is a squished donut shape - oval. Different bars of light at dif orientations. Horizontal: very little in the on area, trigger some of off area - a little slower (cell in primary visual cortex). Tilted bar - mroe of on area active - morea ctivity. Perfectly vertical in middle - most of on - maximum activity. Move bar over,only off, stops firing. This simple cell is respopnsive to bars of light in a speicifc orientation and a speicifc location. If whole thing: moderate, some on, off.</li>
	<li>Complex cortical cell: more or less an on region. Vertical bar anywhere - lots of firing. As soon as you tilt it, less firing. Responsive to a particular orientation, but less sensitive to location.</li>
	<li>End-stopped cells - On region and off region. If it's only on on region, strong response. If it crosses over, it's gonna get inhibited - weak or no response. Gives you idea of boundaries of objects. You can get an idea of where features end. </li>
</ul>

<p>First we extract some features, then combine features together to create the perception of entire obejcts. Way: the binding problem - how it binds things together so it's not just a smattering of features. But we don't know how it works. </p>
<p>This all occurs in primary visual cortex. It's critical for conscious processing. What happens when you damage PVC: DB - arterial malformation - blood vessels started to misform. Had to try and cut this thing out of PVC to relieve problem. Hemienopia - see nothing from the left side of space (on right side). Just darkness. Not like hemispatial neglect (you have a functioning PVC, info is coming in, but you're just not attending to it. Here, you're getting it to the right side but no tissue to receive it, so not sending it forward. Most of DB's left half field was blind. Could locate objects in left blind field. He can't see but can locate objects. Could it be he's getting info to the super colliculus. Other pathways don't give you conscious perception. This phenomenon: <span class="key">Blindsight</span>. </p>
<p>After Area V1, info goes to other areas. Multiple visual areas. Primary, secondary, etc. End up going to multiple areas of the brain - 2 pathways: </p>
<ul>
	<li>"Where" pathway - magnocellular projection - where information - movement, location, space. Dorsal stream.</li>
	<li>"What" pathway - conscious object recognition. Shape, colour, faces, places. Parvocellular. Ventral stream. </li>
</ul>


<p>Area V4 - responsive to colour. Depends on both parvo, konio. Important for color, visual attention. <span class="ex">Patient with damage. Oliver Sacs - Theh Case of the Colourblind Painter. Couldn't distinguish greek letters, colours. All black and white. Then focus went super. But colourblind. Turns out, it occurs when you damage area V4.  </span> <span class="key">Achromatopsia</span> - lose ability to maintain colour constancy (red apple regardless - keeps changing colour) or to perceive colour - Cortical colour blindness. Colour is a construct of your brain. If you damage area that proceses colour, you're not going to see colour anymore. You can be conscious of everything else, but you've turned the dial on colour. Samir Zeki: You can't think of consciousness of one thing - dif areas of brain giving rise to dif aspects of consciousness - multiple consciousnesses that work together.  </p>
<p>How processing unfolds as you go down ventral stream in monkey. TEO: Temporal occiptal. TE: Temporal. Receptive sizes of each area. ( you can disrupt visual processing with that electromagnetic thing). Converging onto fewer neurons - receptive field grows bigger cause responsive to more. Prefrontal cortex to provide you with a response. Also happens in temporal lobe. Always adding multiple cells in prev layer convering making receptive field larger. And prcessing more stuff, more complex as you go down.  </p>
<p>Ventral aspect of the temporal cortex. Horn of the temporal lobe from bottom. Cells specifically responsive to dif places (PPA), and a dif area responsive to face area (FFA). Dif area resposnive to dif categories of objects. Specific areas responsive to animate and inanimate objects. Responsive to objects reagardless of specific features - whether person is under bright/dark light, looking to left/right, etc. Constancy. Baylis and Driver. <span class="ex">Face: Gestalt figure ground stimulus. because border is with background. Neurons respond to face even though it's reverse contrast or changed orientation. If you figure-ground reversal, the neuron stops responding - because white region is enclosed, it reads white region as object. Stop firing even though it's very similar. What matters for ventral/temporal neurons is what the interpretation is, not what the low-level features. </span></p>
<p>What if you damaged some of these temporal areas? <span class="key">Visual Agnosia</span> - can see visual stimulus, but lose ability to recognise them. <span class="ex">Patient shown fountain pen - that's a light. Once touches, recognizes it's a pen. Failure of recognition by vision alone. Big wall mirror - That is a lamp made of glass. Seems to have a horse in it. Donkey -> Napolean. Horse -> Horse. Not all or none. They have graded impairment - how much damage to cortex.   </span>  Can have category impairment - places, faces. <span class="ex">D.F. - damage near occipital - <span class="key">Apperceptive Agnosia</span> - visual form agnosia. Can't put together basic features of objects. Can't copy drawings. Can draw from memory but not that good. IF you ask what they drew, wont remember what they drrew. </span> <span class="key">ASsociative agnosia</span> - get pieces together but cant attach label/meaning of what they're seeing. CAn do things like copy objects. While copying it, no idea what they're drawing. Can match objectes. Trouble drawing from memory. Can get meaning connected to physical features of object. Can't go from book -> image.  </p>
<p>Appercetive  Agnosic - D.F. - Slot in a circle. She stands back and using vision, she has to orient her hand so it's in line ith the slot. Simulating slot orientation at a distance. ARrow - orientation of slot - others are DF's attempts. Tell DF to post the letter into the slot - she's able to orient her hand quite well. Her perception for action is in tact, but perception for identificaiton of orientation for slot is impaired. Damage to her ventral stream but not to her dorsal stream (action, movement). A spared secondary stream to do well on motor movement but poor on vision type things. </p>
<p>Prosopagnosia - fail to recognize faces. Identify people by remembering a speciifc feature of that individual - just see features, you gate (way you walk), voice. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 15: June 25, 2018</p>
<p>Visual agnosia - unable to recognize objects through vision. Prosopagnosia - cant recognize faces. </p>
<p>Early preference for facial stimuli. Researchers use <span class="key">habituation</span> - things that the baby will find interesting, they'll look at longer, not itnerested will habituate to them and not look at them. Faces get a lot of looking time. Face perception occurs very early on. Baby is born for the propensity for faces. </p>
<p><span class="key">Optic Ataxia</span> - specific problem in being able to use vision for action, especially for reaching for objects. In tact ability to recognize objects. They can recognize objects, but cant act on them. Opposite with visual agnosia, where you can't recognize but you can act on it. Double dissociation - dissociating ability for use vision for recognition from using vision for action. Maps on to 2 different streams for perception - vental (recognition) and dorsol (localizing and action) stream. </p>

<p>Dorsal stream - go up. Involved in motion perception. <span class="key">Middle-temporal cortex (MT/V5)</span> . <span class="key">Medial superior temporal cortex (MST)</span>; MT has retinal topic representation - adjacent areas in space are in adjacent areas in MT. Also has small receptive fields. Responsive to direction of movement, specific feed at which somehting is moving, changes in speed, objects moving relative to background (car on background); MST has a coarser retinotopic map. Large receptive fields. Involved in expansion and contraction (cue for someothing moving away/towards you), rotation of objects, object movement relative to background; Superor Tempora sulcus (ST) and Inferior temporal sulcus (ITS). Image thinned out gyri - schematic to see stuff. </p>
<p>Case studies of individuals with damage to MT - symptoms: perceive the world as a series of still images (difficult to interact with the world, learn to use other sorts of cues to navigate like sound) - <span class="key">motion blindless / akinatopsia</span>. </p>
<p>Damage to other areas, but spare area MT - people can't see objects, but they can guess with high degree of accuracy which way an object is moving. Might see a motion blur.</p>
<p>Paralell representation from multiple areas. </p>

<p>Deficits? Conditions? </p>
<p><span class="key">Strabismus</span> - eyes don't point in the same direction. Aka lazy eye. You're getting different, uncorrelated info from the two eyes. There are some areas responsive to both eyes, so it's hard to get a coherent signal to make sense of what's happening in the world. Brain will try to create connections with the dominant eye and not with the lazy one. They will become functionally blind in the lazy eye as the brain is ignoring it - you have deficits that are monocular and bincocular: don't have depth perception, occlusion.<br>Common old treatment: patch the good eye - force the individual to use lazy eye to do the work, so the brain would make connections. But what you really want is to coordinate both eyes. Now developing interesting games that involve stereoscopic depth perception. Video games where the individual has to control both eyes so that the 3d image pops up.</p>
<p>Critical periods; if you deprive stimulation to one eye, system will make connections with the non-deprived eye, reduce connections with deprived eye. If deprive both eyes - more sluggish response, but attain ability to see things. Since no input, there wasn't one eye that outcompeted one eye. System was in limbo for a while. Need early development to experience external world to create a little more pruning of synapses to work with the environment.<br>If shown horizontal lines only, the visual cortex will not be responsive to vertical lines. Show one type of stimulus, prevents it from reacting to other stimulus.</p>

<h1>Audition</h1>
<p>What's the stimulus for hearing - compression for air particles. Vibrating vocal chords, compressing air, which travel through airspace and come in contact with ears. Model these compressions with waves.</p>
<p>Compression travleing through air in a wave. <span class="key">Amplitude</span> - height of the hill - corresponds to loudness. <span class="key">Frequency</span> - as it unfolds over time, length of one sinusoidal movement, converts to pitch. <span class="key">Complexity</span> of the wave - a combination of sinusoidal waves, codes for us the quality of the sound. <span class="ex">Violin and piano have dif composition.</span> Decompose complex waves into simple pure tones (simple sign waves). Pure tones vs. Comination of pure tones (complex). Decompose using <span class="key">Spectral decomposition</span>. Timbre/colour of the sound. </p>
<p>It's not 1 to 1. Still reconstructing things. Physical vs Psychological characteristics of sound - Psychophysics. </p>
<p>The organ for hearing: ear. Outside: flapping piec eof skin, <!-- called the Pina. Make sure you don't mispronounce that. --> Inside flappy part: concha. Inside head: connected to <span class="key">Auditory canal</span> - that's the part where you stick the qtip in. If too far, you hit the ear drum. Vibrates the <span class="key">Tympanic membrane (Eeardrum)</span>.; Move to segment of middle air (3 primary bones - malleus, incus, stapes - connected to each other and carry vibrations from t membrane to inner ear).; Stapes vibrates antoher membrane, ovla window, which goes to the cochlea. Only chochlea in yellow part is involved in audition. Auditory nerve connexts to various parts of choclea; What you're doing is translating vibration coming from the air particles and moving it through organic tissue. </p>
<p><!-- "This is a really old picture from Gray. You guys probably watch Grey's Anatomy?"  --> Cochlea - snail. Long thing. If you cut cochlea and look inside... 3 different spaces. SCala Vestibuli , Scala Tympani - both contain perilymph. Scala Media - contains endolymph (fluid). Red box - organ of corti - where a lot of the work happens. When you vibrate oval window, it will make the fluid move. Movement of fluid will send a wave that will vibrate the basilar membrane, which activats the organ of corti.<br>uditry nerve fibre coming in. Inner and outer hair cells - poke up into the endolyph fluid and form hair-like protrusions called cilia. Tectorial membrane comes close to cilia (some cases attached).</p>
<p>1. sound comes in vibrates the tympanic membraen; vibration of ... sends a wave of fluid to vestibular canal; if unroll, vestibular canal continuous with tampanic canal. Wave down whole thing; 2) 3) waves push basilar membrane up and down. 4) 5) </p>
<p>End up moving basilar membrane and organ of corti up and down depending on the fluid in the chochlea. It makes the cilia move back and forth within the cochlear duct. Cilia are connected to auditory nerve. Whenver they move, they trigger action potentials in hair cells that get converted to action potentials within auditory nerve. No action potentials in cilia, but in auditory nerve.</p>
<p>Cilia are staggered in their height. They're connected by a very thin fibre.<br>a hair cell with cilia protruding up, and a spiral ganglion neuron (auditory nerve). They're being bathed in endolyph - very high in potassium. When ion channels open, potassium flows out, but here cause theres so much K+ in endolyph, potassium will flow in.<br>The cilia aren't all exactly the same height - microfilaments that connect the taller ones to the shorter neighbours - tip links. Tip link is attached directly to an ion channel - potassium. 15% of potassium channels are open, positive charge entering. Some sort of depolarization, which triggers calcium channels to come in, vesicles release a NT (glutamate) and activate spiral ganglion neuron - moderate action. When soundwave comes in, movement of paralimph. Which moves against corti. <br>From shorter side to longer side. Increasing the distance between tip link cilia - pulls microfilament and pulls open ion channels. <span class="key">Mechanical-gated</span>. (many mechanisms to open up ion channels). All sorts of potassium flows in, larger depolar, more calcium flowing in (voltage gated)<br>Goes other way, reduces distance, less tension, closes channels, hyperpolarize, stop. Every time cilia moves, you change firing of neurons.<br>Air pressure changes manipulating vibration of tissue which creates waves in fluid which vibrates membranes which cilia moves and mechanically opens/closes ion channels. Potassium gets pumped out (potassium exchangers - pumps). Many different transfer points.</p>

<p>Hwo do we code for dif types of information? Pitch perception - idea is that pitch is related to frequency of sound wave. </p>
<p><span class="key">Place Theory</span> - dif places along the cochlea had cells that were sensitive to different frequencies. </p>
<p><span class="key">Frequency Theory</span> - whole thing moves in synchronity with frquency. Firing rate would code for pitch information. Stiffness - responsive to high freq. Floppy - responsive to low freq. Don't want a lot of movement for high freq. </p>

<p>Now we know, that both things are likley going. Low frquency sounds explaine dby frequency theory - whole basilar memb will vibe in synchronity. Problem: we're sensitiyve to frquences that outpace the neuron. The neuron can't keep up with it. <span class="key">The Volley Principle</span> - when you have relatively high frequency, not one single neuron can fire with every single peak. EAch neuron might be able to keep up with every X peak. Now multiple neurons work together ti cover all peaks. Every cna only fire every Xth peak, but collectively you have represented a firing with every peak of the sound wave. Collectively reproduce the frequency even though each can't handle it alone. Neurons in specific places in cochlea that fire at partic rates. Multiple thing sin play together. </p>
<p>How would you localize sound in space? Spatial localization - Vision gives us very good spatial info. Audition is not as good, better for temporal info. Vision is sluggish - this is why we can have movies. Monitors work the same way - refresh rate. Hearing: operates at a much faster temporal resolution. Localizing sound is quite challenging.<br>Mechanisms to localize sound in a horizontal plane. Interaural time difference - sound coming from one side, hits one year before the other ear - delta(t) difference in time between 2 ears receiving info - brain computes time difference. If it hits both ears, its in front or behind. - This is just one cue; Interaural level difference - when sound coming from one side, hits the first ear and is louder than more distant ear because head absorbs some of the sound. Small, but system can detect. delta I - difference in intensity between 2 ears. Best for higher frequency tones. But still cant tell if in front or behind or vertically.; (image 3: f > 2kHz) For vertical/front/back, antoher cue: uses frequency information (pitch). Outer flappy part, pena, has grooves - it creates a spectral notch in the frequency band. Bounce around the sounds and has signature effec ton the wave lengths coming into your ear-  very dif depending on angle. If you got nice, big, flappy ears, it's great for sound localization. You should be very excited about that. If you were to remov ethe pena, you can actually do this yourself. Don't chop your pena off. Molds of people's pena - everyone has individual shape - if yoou put someone else's mold of their pena, you stil wont be able to localize sound cause you need your own pena. About 6 dif categories of pena. 1 will capture yours pretty closely.</p>
<p>Auditory stream: in meddula, hit cochlear nucleus - info splits into dif pathways (parallel info transfer), some go to superior olive and on opposite side. Dorsal to inferior colliculus. Lateral lemniscus  - pathway. Converges in the inferior colliculus (audition). Some info goes to superior colliculus (combo of vision and auditon). Go to the thalamus - medial geniculate nucleus. (corresponding for visual -dorsal lateral genic nucleus). sensory relay center. goes to auditory cortex. Add spectral processing in dorsal cochlear nucleus - verticla positioning. ITD and ILD in superior olive. In superior olive, neurons called concidence detectors. </p>
<p>sound info comes from cochlea , cochlear nucleus, trapexzoid body -sending axons to superior olive neuron. Cell body with dendrites coming out. Inputs -  excitatory and inhibitory coming from left and right side. Each neuron is tuned so it's gonna maximally respond depending on if its coming from left or right side. Like a temporal summation. All active at the same time, depolarized heavily - fire. Tuning curve. Highest when sound is coming more from contralateral side. This partic neuron is more responsive when sound coming from opposite side - just an example. </p>
<p>In  the auditory cortex: on superior part of temporal lobe, heschel gyrus where the p auditory cortex is. That part of the cortex - certain areas (a - highly responsive to freq in 3000s range, b: 1000, c: 800) - creating a tonaltopic map, where adjacent freq are represented in adj areas in the cortex. Mirrored axis - f responsive again up to 3000. Some areas specifically (red yellow) more representative of pitch. and other areas mroe responsive to localization of sound. Dorsal - localizing sound. Temporal - pitch. </p>
