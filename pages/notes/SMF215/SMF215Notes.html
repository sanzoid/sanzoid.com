<p>Popular culture is not an object, it's a place we're usd to living in.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is <span class="key">sexy</span>?</li>
	<li>How do you know when something or someone is sexy?</li>
	<li>Is it entirely our own tastes and preferences? There's a cultural/media influence.</li>
	<li>Things can also be sexy. <span class="ex">Lingerie, food porn.</span></li>
	<li>"Sexy" has changed over time, it's in flux.</li>
</ul>

<ul>Definitions of <span class="key">Sexy</span>
	<li>sexually attractive or exciting. Ex: sexy french underwear</li>
	<li>sexually aroused. "Neither of them was feeling sexy."</li>
	<li>informal: exiting; appealing. "a sexy career"</li>
</ul>

<p>Definitions are descriptive and include a sexual aspect.</p>
<p>Sexy is hard to define. They're your tastes and proclivities. Are they true reflections of your tastes and feelings? Is it programmed?</p>

<p>Mass/pop culture and sexy. </p>
<ul>Sex sells.
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc-koq4KJDM">Matthew McConaughey + car</a>Selling you a lifestyle. Buy this car, you get this lifestyle. Advertised to young men with money. People want to be Matthew McConaughey.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p639LPzZ8aI">Kate Walsh + car.</a> "When you turn your car on, does it return the favour?" Different because she, a woman, is driving it.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0ZxBgqU6M">Kate Upton + Carls Jr</a>She's having sex with a hamburger in a drive-in. The behaviour would seem ridiculous in real life. It invokes a psychological response.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B02DGmkqDDU">Cindy Crawford + Pepsi</a>Children. </li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GERnFiBSmXM">Motorola (Red)</a>People of colour. Real nudity instead of suggested nudity. Nudity suggests which bodies are more accessible. Seen as artistic/high culture. </li>
</ul>
	
<p>The study of pop culture is a study of power.</p>
<p>We're surrounded by sex and sexuality. Celebrity culture, magazines, talk shows, etc.</p>
<p>It works in advertising as it plays on modern concepts of sexuality. From the 1830s to today.</p>
<p>Sexuality is  an essential piece of identity. It's a critical part of who people are.We draw on categories to make sense of who we are. Sexuality almost never stands alone in identity, it intersects with age, gender, race, etc. We take an <span class="key">intersectional approach</span> - the categories often meet.</p>

<p>18th-19th century - new emphasis on sexuality. Started in Europe, colonialism. There are still languages that don't have a term for "sexuality". But people have always been engaging in sexual activities. We're not talking about sex. Sexuality refers to identity, how people make sense of erotic experiences. As much about culture as it is about society. It's shaped by social and political forces. Sexuality, sex, and gender are closely interwined. It forms a matrix that defines norms.

<h1>What is Culture?</h1>
<ul>Two overlapping definitions: 
	<li>Culture (Capital C) - High culture. Stuff associated with elite cultural conditions.<span class="ex">"That person is very cultured." Ballet, Mona Lisa, Shakespeare, Opera, etc.</span></li>
	<li>Culture (Lowecase C) - A whole way of life of a society or a distinct subsection of a society (subcultures). The art, food, rituals, work, religion, sex, family, friendship, sports. National cultures.<br>Raymond Williams - culture is one of the most complciated words in english. 
	<ol>He had 3 general categories for criticism/analysis:  
		<li><span class="key">The Ideal</span> - State/process of perfection in terms of certain absolute universal values. "The Human Condition" - The essence of all humanity in spite of all the different cultures. The description of a whole way of a social life.</li>
		<li><span class="key">The Documentary</span> - A body of intellectual and imaginative work which, in a detailed way, human thought and experience are variously recorded. It's historical. Music, literature, fine art. Record of culture.</li>
		<li><span class="key">Social</span> - A description of a particular way of life which express certain meanings and values, not only in art and learning, but also in institutions and ordinary behaviour. Culture in our every day life, sometimes referred to as <span class="key">Folk culture</span>. <span class="ex">Detective novels, pulp fiction, trashy romance novels.</span>Not necessarily high culture, but stuff people like.</li>
	</ol>
	His definition is criticized much. He says it's far too complex to have a simplistic definition. 
	</li>
</ul>

<h1>What is popular?</h1>
<p>It's not a fixed thing. <span class="key">Popular</span> is a contested field of products and practices. It's taste. People have debates about it. It includes morals, judgements, and values. Forces and processes shape our understanding of what pop culture is. </p>
<p>It reflects an experience of culture. Emerges in a <span class="key">capitalist consumer society</span> (where we don't produce what we need, but we buy what we need). It's also shaped by the technology of mass media (newspaper, radio, television, internet). It blurs the two meanings of pop culture. It's not high or folk, it's a combination of all of these things together. Pop culture is a (contested) sight of meaning-making practice.</p>

<h1>Cultural Studies</h1>
<p>Cultural studies is a wider umbrella. Can't avoid culture. <span class="ex">Richard von Krafft-Ebing - sexologist. Wrote a book on sexual disorders - Psychopathia sexualis - for medical and legal professions. A quote from the book describes lesbianism, and basically defines homesexuality.</span> </p>
<p>Studying pop culture is like studying capitalism. The economic system is based on private ownership of the means of production and distrubtion. It's geared towards profit. The economy and culture linked. The goal is to sell you things. <span class="ex">When you watch an ad and you didn't know you needed it until you saw the ad.</span> Culture and economy share the examination of cultural practices as they relate to power.</p>
<ul>Cultural Studies' definition of culture:
	<li>Conventional texts</li>
	<li>Ways of life that become texts of study</li>
	<li>Abstract structures - language, beliefs, common sense, etc. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Mass Culture</h1>
<p><span class="key">Mass Culture</span> - synonymous with popular culture. But they're not the same. Mass culture is derogatory. If you like mass culture, it means you're boring. Popular culture is a shared experience. Mass culture is culture provided for profit by a <span class="key">vertically integrated factory system</span> (company owns the entire supply chain) for a large and diverse audience. Mass culture started breaking down with <span class="key">Market segmentation</span> - markets used to be a whole, but now there are different segments. <span class="ex">Cater to the child, soccer mom, ethnic consumer, etc.</span></p>

<h1>Identity Politics</h1>
<p><span class="key">Identity politics</span> is the practice of basing one's politics on a sense of personal identity. <span class="ex">Female or male, gay or straight.</span>A tool to build a cohesive political community. It's identity with a political movement. You need to claim the identity. Pros: it encourages new political groupings and new visiblity (disabilities). Cons: Fractured, hard to merge different groups. There's stunded analysis if it's just a statement as opposed to an interrogation. <span class="key">Problematic essentialism</span> - the experience only speaks for itself.</p>

<p class="date">Lecture 3: Jan 10, 2018</p>
<p>Discussion - reactions to text in general and stuff to discuss. Issue around generational conflict - textbook doesn't cover. Shakespeare vs. Madonna. Third spaces - Starbucks. Coffee. Go for the experience. Sense of agency. Paradynamics. Anything can be a text - even a store. Popular culture vs. art. More education -> more likely you are to attend an art gallery - an elite space. There's a price on culture. Cost. Opera house - intimidating - I'm not this person. Class hierarchy that mimics culture hierarchy. Popular defined as homogenous, more common, lower brow - all class judgements. Americanization of popular culture. Stereotypes become part of culture. The hockey thing. </p>
<p>Popular culture: Whatever is popular is profitable. Internet - it's free, but you give up privacy, data. Free for the user - democratization of culture. Spinoffs from the media - toys, clothing, jewelry. Authenticity - pop culture is superficial - I don't wanna buy jewelry from mall, wanna buy from local artisan -> more authentic - tastes and money. If you have a folk culture, and it's popularized, you lose the authenticity. We're tools of the industry - we take what we get and we're thankful for it - we think it's our own choice. Culture industry thesis - other side - culture has to resonate with the poeple who its directed towards. Popular culture x Creativity x Economy - file sharing. </p>
<p>Napster - first big filesharing system. Filesharing came from changes in systems. Introduction of CDs - required new systems - said price will come down, but it didn't. Interplay between consumers and industry - two way street, not just top-down. </p>
<p>Another element of popular culture: Intersectional between political and pop culture. Pride events - tied to popular culture. Trump - from reality TV - The Apprentice - how people become household names. Oprah - Golden Globes. Brian Adams - Canadian musician - crossed over to American markets - movie with Kevin Costner - Brian Adams sang themesong - did not count as Canadian Content - because you needed Canadian producers/writers. Nationalism - national identity. </p>
<p>Popular culture is a wave - starts small, goes up, down. Caught up with it. Easy to swim with than against. Ex. Toronto - cosmopolitan now. Basic if with wave, or hipster if against. Subcultures get taken in with the wave.</p>
<p>What's "folk" culture? Tied to a particular community. In opposition to mass culture. Folk culture is seen as being expressed or relayed generationally. You have to be part of the culture to have it passed down to it. Not a faceless mass. Folk culture is internal and small. Folk culture -> mass culture - rap music - emerging from South Bronx - now a billion dollar industry. Cultural appropriation - take folk culture, strip of location, and absorb into mass. Some say folk culture is better, but that's a debate. "The culture of everyday life." The definition of pop culture now relies on anthropology - more anthropological than capitalistical, literary, morality. 3 important things of pop uclture as everyday life: 1. mass media - a part of it, not split, 2. meaning-making - make things meaningful, production of sense and social value - taste. 3. Highlights the issue of power. </p>
<p>Why we should study popular culture. Criticism - we all consume blindly. pop culture helps you denaturalize processes we're caught up in every day by making them meaningful. Cultural appropriation. Fashion - tied to what people think makes them sexy or "exotic." Some criticism - you're just training people to be better consumers. Frankfurt school - people are mindless consumers and that's what's wrong with the world. Others - people can buy things and be thoughtful about it. </p>
<p>Commodity fetish - Coffee. Karl Marx. Meanings on material objects. Objects imbued with magical qualities. Fetish is a fixation, something that will give you pleasure. Particular commodities are imbued with same magical qualities. Shoes. Followers, likes, hashtags. Barbecueing. Children looking like adults. "This will make things correct" Make up - brow gel is $80, but the actual product is not worth that much - no logical connection. </p>
<p>Tim HOrtons vs. Starbucks - brand is close with identity. Tim Hortons person or a Starbucks person - cosmopolitan, international. </p>
