<p>Popular culture is not an object, it's a place we're usd to living in.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is <span class="key">sexy</span>?</li>
	<li>How do you know when something or someone is sexy?</li>
	<li>Is it entirely our own tastes and preferences? There's a cultural/media influence.</li>
	<li>Things can also be sexy. <span class="ex">Lingerie, food porn.</span></li>
	<li>"Sexy" has changed over time, it's in flux.</li>
</ul>

<ul>Definitions of <span class="key">Sexy</span>
	<li>sexually attractive or exciting. Ex: sexy french underwear</li>
	<li>sexually aroused. "Neither of them was feeling sexy."</li>
	<li>informal: exiting; appealing. "a sexy career"</li>
</ul>

<p>Definitions are descriptive and include a sexual aspect.</p>
<p>Sexy is hard to define. They're your tastes and proclivities. Are they true reflections of your tastes and feelings? Is it programmed?</p>

<p>Mass/pop culture and sexy. </p>
<ul>Sex sells.
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc-koq4KJDM">Matthew McConaughey + car</a>Selling you a lifestyle. Buy this car, you get this lifestyle. Advertised to young men with money. People want to be Matthew McConaughey.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p639LPzZ8aI">Kate Walsh + car.</a> "When you turn your car on, does it return the favour?" Different because she, a woman, is driving it.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0ZxBgqU6M">Kate Upton + Carls Jr</a>She's having sex with a hamburger in a drive-in. The behaviour would seem ridiculous in real life. It invokes a psychological response.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B02DGmkqDDU">Cindy Crawford + Pepsi</a>Children. </li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GERnFiBSmXM">Motorola (Red)</a>People of colour. Real nudity instead of suggested nudity. Nudity suggests which bodies are more accessible. Seen as artistic/high culture. </li>
</ul>
	
<p>The study of pop culture is a study of power.</p>
<p>We're surrounded by sex and sexuality. Celebrity culture, magazines, talk shows, etc.</p>
<p>It works in advertising as it plays on modern concepts of sexuality. From the 1830s to today.</p>
<p>Sexuality is  an essential piece of identity. It's a critical part of who people are.We draw on categories to make sense of who we are. Sexuality almost never stands alone in identity, it intersects with age, gender, race, etc. We take an <span class="key">intersectional approach</span> - the categories often meet.</p>

<p>18th-19th century - new emphasis on sexuality. Started in Europe, colonialism. There are still languages that don't have a term for "sexuality". But people have always been engaging in sexual activities. We're not talking about sex. Sexuality refers to identity, how people make sense of erotic experiences. As much about culture as it is about society. It's shaped by social and political forces. Sexuality, sex, and gender are closely interwined. It forms a matrix that defines norms.
</p>

<h1>What is Culture?</h1>
<ul>Two overlapping definitions: 
	<li>Culture (Capital C) - High culture. Stuff associated with elite cultural conditions.<span class="ex">"That person is very cultured." Ballet, Mona Lisa, Shakespeare, Opera, etc.</span></li>
	<li>Culture (Lowecase C) - A whole way of life of a society or a distinct subsection of a society (subcultures). The art, food, rituals, work, religion, sex, family, friendship, sports. National cultures.<br>Raymond Williams - culture is one of the most complciated words in english. 
	<ol>He had 3 general categories for criticism/analysis:  
		<li><span class="key">The Ideal</span> - State/process of perfection in terms of certain absolute universal values. "The Human Condition" - The essence of all humanity in spite of all the different cultures. The description of a whole way of a social life.</li>
		<li><span class="key">The Documentary</span> - A body of intellectual and imaginative work which, in a detailed way, human thought and experience are variously recorded. It's historical. Music, literature, fine art. Record of culture.</li>
		<li><span class="key">Social</span> - A description of a particular way of life which express certain meanings and values, not only in art and learning, but also in institutions and ordinary behaviour. Culture in our every day life, sometimes referred to as <span class="key">Folk culture</span>. <span class="ex">Detective novels, pulp fiction, trashy romance novels.</span>Not necessarily high culture, but stuff people like.</li>
	</ol>
	His definition is criticized much. He says it's far too complex to have a simplistic definition. 
	</li>
</ul>

<h1>What is popular?</h1>
<p>It's not a fixed thing. <span class="key">Popular</span> is a contested field of products and practices. It's taste. People have debates about it. It includes morals, judgements, and values. Forces and processes shape our understanding of what pop culture is. </p>
<p>It reflects an experience of culture. Emerges in a <span class="key">capitalist consumer society</span> (where we don't produce what we need, but we buy what we need). It's also shaped by the technology of mass media (newspaper, radio, television, internet). It blurs the two meanings of pop culture. It's not high or folk, it's a combination of all of these things together. Pop culture is a (contested) sight of meaning-making practice.</p>

<h1>Cultural Studies</h1>
<p>Cultural studies is a wider umbrella. Can't avoid culture. <span class="ex">Richard von Krafft-Ebing - sexologist. Wrote a book on sexual disorders - Psychopathia sexualis - for medical and legal professions. A quote from the book describes lesbianism, and basically defines homesexuality.</span> </p>
<p>Studying pop culture is like studying capitalism. The economic system is based on private ownership of the means of production and distrubtion. It's geared towards profit. The economy and culture linked. The goal is to sell you things. <span class="ex">When you watch an ad and you didn't know you needed it until you saw the ad.</span> Culture and economy share the examination of cultural practices as they relate to power.</p>
<ul>Cultural Studies' definition of culture:
	<li>Conventional texts</li>
	<li>Ways of life that become texts of study</li>
	<li>Abstract structures - language, beliefs, common sense, etc. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Mass Culture</h1>
<p><span class="key">Mass Culture</span> - synonymous with popular culture. But they're not the same. Mass culture is derogatory. If you like mass culture, it means you're boring. Popular culture is a shared experience. Mass culture is culture provided for profit by a <span class="key">vertically integrated factory system</span> (company owns the entire supply chain) for a large and diverse audience. Mass culture started breaking down with <span class="key">Market segmentation</span> - markets used to be a whole, but now there are different segments. <span class="ex">Cater to the child, soccer mom, ethnic consumer, etc.</span></p>

<h1>Identity Politics</h1>
<p><span class="key">Identity politics</span> is the practice of basing one's politics on a sense of personal identity. <span class="ex">Female or male, gay or straight.</span>A tool to build a cohesive political community. It's identity with a political movement. You need to claim the identity. Pros: it encourages new political groupings and new visiblity (disabilities). Cons: Fractured, hard to merge different groups. There's stunded analysis if it's just a statement as opposed to an interrogation. <span class="key">Problematic essentialism</span> - the experience only speaks for itself.</p>

<p class="date">Lecture 3: Jan 10, 2018</p>
<p>Discussion - reactions to text in general and stuff to discuss. Issue around generational conflict - textbook doesn't cover. Shakespeare vs. Madonna. Third spaces - Starbucks. Coffee. Go for the experience. Sense of agency. Paradynamics. Anything can be a text - even a store. Popular culture vs. art. More education -> more likely you are to attend an art gallery - an elite space. There's a price on culture. Cost. Opera house - intimidating - I'm not this person. Class hierarchy that mimics culture hierarchy. Popular defined as homogenous, more common, lower brow - all class judgements. Americanization of popular culture. Stereotypes become part of culture. The hockey thing. </p>
<p>Popular culture: Whatever is popular is profitable. Internet - it's free, but you give up privacy, data. Free for the user - democratization of culture. Spinoffs from the media - toys, clothing, jewelry. Authenticity - pop culture is superficial - I don't wanna buy jewelry from mall, wanna buy from local artisan -> more authentic - tastes and money. If you have a folk culture, and it's popularized, you lose the authenticity. We're tools of the industry - we take what we get and we're thankful for it - we think it's our own choice. Culture industry thesis - other side - culture has to resonate with the poeple who its directed towards. Popular culture x Creativity x Economy - file sharing. </p>
<p>Napster - first big filesharing system. Filesharing came from changes in systems. Introduction of CDs - required new systems - said price will come down, but it didn't. Interplay between consumers and industry - two way street, not just top-down. </p>
<p>Another element of popular culture: Intersectional between political and pop culture. Pride events - tied to popular culture. Trump - from reality TV - The Apprentice - how people become household names. Oprah - Golden Globes. Brian Adams - Canadian musician - crossed over to American markets - movie with Kevin Costner - Brian Adams sang themesong - did not count as Canadian Content - because you needed Canadian producers/writers. Nationalism - national identity. </p>
<p>Popular culture is a wave - starts small, goes up, down. Caught up with it. Easy to swim with than against. Ex. Toronto - cosmopolitan now. Basic if with wave, or hipster if against. Subcultures get taken in with the wave.</p>
<p>What's "folk" culture? Tied to a particular community. In opposition to mass culture. Folk culture is seen as being expressed or relayed generationally. You have to be part of the culture to have it passed down to it. Not a faceless mass. Folk culture is internal and small. Folk culture -> mass culture - rap music - emerging from South Bronx - now a billion dollar industry. Cultural appropriation - take folk culture, strip of location, and absorb into mass. Some say folk culture is better, but that's a debate. "The culture of everyday life." The definition of pop culture now relies on anthropology - more anthropological than capitalistical, literary, morality. 3 important things of pop uclture as everyday life: 1. mass media - a part of it, not split, 2. meaning-making - make things meaningful, production of sense and social value - taste. 3. Highlights the issue of power. </p>
<p>Why we should study popular culture. Criticism - we all consume blindly. pop culture helps you denaturalize processes we're caught up in every day by making them meaningful. Cultural appropriation. Fashion - tied to what people think makes them sexy or "exotic." Some criticism - you're just training people to be better consumers. Frankfurt school - people are mindless consumers and that's what's wrong with the world. Others - people can buy things and be thoughtful about it. </p>
<p>Commodity fetish - Coffee. Karl Marx. Meanings on material objects. Objects imbued with magical qualities. Fetish is a fixation, something that will give you pleasure. Particular commodities are imbued with same magical qualities. Shoes. Followers, likes, hashtags. Barbecueing. Children looking like adults. "This will make things correct" Make up - brow gel is $80, but the actual product is not worth that much - no logical connection. </p>
<p>Tim HOrtons vs. Starbucks - brand is close with identity. Tim Hortons person or a Starbucks person - cosmopolitan, international. </p>

<h1>Ideology</h1>

<p><span class="key">Ideology</span> - difficult to define. The <strong>background</strong> ideas that we possess about the way the world must function and how we must function within it. It's just the way things are. These ideas have a material existence. They directly connect to our lives and how we operate.</p>
<p> Goldstein's definition: ideology is a system possessing its logic and proper rigour of representations, image,s smyths, ideas or concepts endowed with an exisence and a historical role at the heart of a given society. A system of representations at the heart of a given society. Values and asusmptions are implicit, and form a shared heart to society. Origins - Marx and Ingles - Marxism - philosophy was broad - ideology itself represents the production of ideas, conceptions, and consciousness. Ideology is all that men say, imagine, and conceive. Ideology was very broad - laws, politics, morality, and religion. It is a <span class="key">Superstructure</span> - the critical piece of the functioning of an entire society. If society is a house, ideology is the frame of the house, not a piece of it, but the entire essential part of it. The dominant ideology of any period/era was always the ideology of the ruling class - the ruling ideas, the dominant ideas - whoever controls the means of production are the ones who have their ideology broadened across society. False consciousness - ideology is a means of social control. It's a way that the ruling class socially controls the working class (classes beneath them). The subordinate classes have false consciousness because they believ ein the world view of the ruling class, even though that world view is not in their benefit. <span class="ex">Religion was the opium of the masses. Religion was this drug. Protestantism - industrialism -> protestant work ethic - if you work really hard in this life, you will be rewarded in heaven. Life will be terrible for you, but heaven will be great. </span>Workers are taking on their worldview against their own needs. </p>
<!--"Bless you. hahah false consciousness, right."-->
<ol>Antonio Gramsci: 
	<li><span class="key">Common sense</span> - ideology often masquerades as common sense. Because it's so implicit so you think there's no judgement there, you think there's no differences between class, etc. practical everyday popular consciousness of human beings. Obviously true or common to everyone, normative. "Well, that's just common sense." <span class="ex">Flushing the toilet. Looking both ways before you cross the street. It's allegedly common sense that if you can see your legs, you can go into that bathroom. Bathroom signs. But it's not common sense. </span>How common sense gets formed. Contradictory body of beliefs that are unified into social common sense. Stuart Hall - working from Gramsci - common sense that combines elements fromt he stone age and principles of a more advanced science, prejducices form all the past histories, at the local level, and intuitions of a future philosophy which will be that from the human race united the world over. It's part history, philosophy. We selectively take peices of history, then say this is how it's always been. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Hegemony</span> - hegemonic - coercion as opposed to force. Not that rulign class forces you to believe it, there's a gentle coercive power at play at getting people on side with a particular worldview. For Gramsci, idea of class is messier. Member sof the working class will believe in the ideology of the ruling class - it's not that they don't know, it's that they still believe -> hegemony. Ordinary people come to be persuaded of specific worldviews. Crucial question: how ideology gets to be believed and lived out? A combination of coercion and consent. </li>
</ol>

<h1>Heteronormativity</h1>
<p><span class="key">Heteronormativity</span> - can be seen as ideology. When did you decide you were heterosexual? When did you start telling people. When did you sit down with your parents and say "I'm heterosexual." It's the assumed norm. It's common sense. Homosexuality was illegal until 1969 in Canada. Adrian Rich - compulsory heterosexuality - is the presumed sexual preference, has cultural dominance, if you don't identify - you're in a deviant other. They are institutionalized. Heterosexuality is something that has to be imposed, managed, organized, propragandized and maintained by force. </p>
<p>Heteronormativity is broader than who you seek sexual activity with. <span class="quote">The received wisdom in straight culture, is that all of its different norms line up, that one is synonymous with the others. If you are born with male genitalia, the logic goes, you will behave in masculine ways, desire women, desire feminine women, desire them exclusively, have sex in what are thought to be normally active and insertive ways and within officially sanctioned contexts, think of yourself as heterosexual, identify with other heterosexuals no matter how tolerant you might wish to be, and never change any part of this package from childhood to senescence. Heterosexuality is often a name for this entire package, even though attachment to the other sex is only one element. If you deviate at any point from this program, you do so at your own cost. And one of the things straight culture hates most is a sign that the different parts of the package might be recombined in an infinite number of ways. But experience shows that this is just what tends to happen. If heterosexuality requires the entire sequence, then it is very fragile. No wonder it needs so much terror to induce compliance. - Michael Warner (The Trouble with Normal)</span> Not just about sex. Wider in terms of sexuality. How you identify, who you identify with, who you settle down with, what types of sex you have. This whole package is never supposed to change. The privileging of a particular relationship - manogamous heterosexual marriage - normal and natural. <span class="ex">Myths and mythologies. Disney princesses. Religion. Rom coms. His and hers. One token representation in a tv show. Children - son: "who you gonna marry when you grow up?" - only ever a little girl. "By the time you grow up, marriage will be dead anyways. Dont worry." Children's clothing. "no homo" - complement a man and instantly reaffirm your sexuality.</span> </p>

<p>Honeymoon. HG Wells toured Niagara Falls 1905. The spot for honeymoons. Described the falls as an alibi for honeymooners. <span class="quote">a thunderous impressive accessory to the artless love-making that fills the surrounding hotels</span></p>
<p>Origins of the honeymoon - a trip after marriage. Alone together. First critical time together. Cement relationship through various sexual practices. Come home expecting a child. In the 1800s: "A bridal tour" - largely an upper class custom, you needed money. The bride and groom and some relatives would travel around to various relatives who couldn't get to the wedding. Concern: too rigorous of travel, for the bride who was responsible for planning, too much stress, too much public attention for that new couple.</p>
<p>Idea developed: private honeymoon. The need to get away from prying eyes - need to go somewhere in nature - distant and less public. Natural, beautiful spots for honeymoons. Reconcile the public embarassment of becoming sexual beings - not supposed to flaunt sex. 1920s - Niagara + honeymoon gets mass marketed - little bits. Big marketing post WW2. Lots of heteronormativity - return to normal after the war. And a need to honeymoon to cement your relationship. Celebrities coming to visit, etc. The meaning of the falls - a religious baptism and there's excitement. Cleansing propertis of water and enticing excitement with all of the water. Nagara was gendered and sexualized as female. "Doing Niagara." Sexualization of a place. <!--People are always falling over into the Falls, so there's an element of danger.--> </p>
<p>Film - Marilyn Monroe - Niagara (1952) - about two couples - marilyn monroe is having an affair on her husband while she's at Niagara with him. She's seducitively posed, as one finds themselves on a stone wall. [Marilyn Monroe - movie trailer] Overlapping of her body, sex, suspense, with honeymoon and the space. A rising rate of marriages. Inspired people to go on their honeymoon at the Falls. 1 year after movie released, 10 million people visited the Falls. With Travel boom - cheaper to travel, people are getting married younger. </p>
<p>There's a wider ideological investment in this type of relationship. You had to have a normal honeymoon to have a proper marriage. Heterosexual marriages produced children, and children are the future. Doctors, psychiatrists, marriage counselors/experts. Sexual compatibility - cement of a marriage. Honeymoons were a foundation point for sexual compatibility - give people the right script for a good honeymoon. "A bad honeymoon may cause lifelong impotence for men, especially for men who are mama's boys who fear women." <span class="ex">Lysol - initially sold as a liquid preperation for feminine hygiene. Douche with Lysol. The natural you was a you that used this concentrated germ killer as a douche. You had to have every preparation. </span>"A bad honeymoon wrecked 3 out of 5 marriages." Bad honeymoons cause nervous/mental disorders. There's not enough therapy afterwards to pull you out of this deficit. Innocent -> sexual person. Assumption that people were showing up at Niagara as virgins. Script giveen to people to avoid a tragedy of marriage. Long and healthy marriage -> healthy societies and nation. Men were supposed to be oversexed and overinterested in sex. Women supposed to be disinterested but willing to do their duty. Men told that this was their hour.</p>
<p>Problem with script: rapey. Popular image: men were to act like cavemen, supposed to act like brutes. And women are supposed to be willing to give in. Dangerous script. According to modern sex experts of the period - women were responsible for men's brutality. Lois Pemberton - after hearing about honeymoon rape - didn't know who to pity more. This is the script developed by experts at the time. Other side of problem: if the roles were reversed - timid man and oversexed woman - allegedly there could be problems. <span class="ex">Ralph and Laura - ralph had insecurity, laura took over during sex - slept as fat apart as possible - 10 yrs later, psychiatrist sees -> script must be followed. </span></p>
<p>Women told not to refuse sex. "She has not to do, but to merely exist." Lie there. Lay down and have sex for the queen (make babies).</p>
<p>New disease: vaginismus. Honeymoon shock. 1950s. Husbands not providing a proper atmosphere. Medicalizaiton of the honeymoon. Both should have a medical examination pre-honeymoon. 70% of men and 50% of women acquired a book on sex life for their honeymoon. Idea: heterosexuality is natural and normal. It's clearly not common sense if you have experts trying to find out what the proper script is. Compulsory heterosexuality rises. In this period, you're supposed to return to normal. Appropriate heterosexual behaviour - important building block for the nation - sex education in post-war period. Lots of emphasis on heterosexuality. Honeymoon - important for everyone - to produce proper families. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 5: Jan 18, 2018</p>
<p>Text - general overview. </p>
<p>Ideology - Ideas and values sahred bt a common population. Often not conscious. Just the way things are - just common sense. Usually a dominant class - dominant ideology comes from this class - morals and values. Dominant ideology is connected to the dominant class. False consciousness - people will take on this dominant ideology and believe in something that is contradicting their own interests - work hard and you will go to heaven. Religion is the opium for the people. </p>
<p>Antonio Gramsci revised ideology - one of the floors of ideology is common sense, other is philosophy. It's so naturalized and normalized through the process of history. Human beings are forgetful beings. Hegemony - top down and bottom up force. Coercion and consent. Soft power and also consent to it. </p>
<p>British History - Conformity of dancing - heteronormativity. Pubs as community spaces. Why is the pub so important? Public and private. Inbetween space. A place where lower class could become middle class for a cheap price. Beer in the pub was of a better quality than the water you could drink. </p>
<p>Why was class needed? Recognition of a need for leisure. They needed it to make better workers. You can't work them to death. Give them a break and they will come back refreshed. Rational recreation. Enclosure of public lands - used to have wide spots, enclosured -> less and less space. Then places like pubs were good. </p>
<p><span class="key">Rational Recreation</span> - had a working class street culture - loafing. Blood sports - animals. Vagrancy, trespassing, etc. Removed the culture form the streets and put it somewhere more reasonable. Matthew Arnold - expose people to the best that has been thought nd known in the world - but this was middle class values - imposed down. </p>
<p>The shift of popular culture is the shift in the economy - shift encapsulated in the industrialization. Mass industry in factroies in urban centres. City pops up around the factory. <span class="key">Fordism</span> - people not manufacturing an entire product - whole assembly line is broken down - do I care about this product? No. It makes goods faster to produce, cheaper to sell to the people. Relationship of worker and thing has changed. Thus, leisure time is really important to keep you going. Stop people from drinking on the job. Modes of production - changed. Rising middle-class - capitalist class that owns/controls the modes of the production. </p>

<p>O Doll Divine</p>
<p>Mary Pickford - America's sweetheart, Canadian. Child actress, grows up but her roles don't grow up. Childlike, adolescent-like. Adolescence is a new category. She was powerful in Hollywood. Part of the film industry - business side. She was mature. Multiple marriages. </p>
<p>What does Studler argue about Mary Pickford? "New Woman" - a certain type of woman that appeared in 1910s - demanded education, right to vote -> Flapper - flighty young woman who's sexually out there. Here is a woman, but not a contemporary. Cultural pedophelia. Nostalgia for the victorian period - all of the attractive qualities of a child in a woman. <span class="key">Pedophelic gaze</span> - it doesn't go away. Birth of youth culture in this time. </p>
<p>Children/girlhood and power - freedom, free of family, etc. Escapist. Orphan. Child outside of the family. </p>
<p>Cultural pedophilia - 386. Child-woman - nostalgic idea of feminity. What women were in the good old days. Carries onto the 20th century - youthful/child-looking people. Beauty pageants. Flipper - fake teeth - adult-like teeth - high heels, bathing suit, etc. <!--"I'm gonna be totally honest. I read the Daily Mail."--> Daddies and little girls. </p>
<p>361 - eroticization of female innocence. taking away the innocence. Being someone's first time. Back then, children were wicked. New formulation of childhood innocence. Origins of child-woman. James Cincaved - sacred chiild was also an eroticization - hugely controversial - you are promoting pedophilia - innocence gets sexuality. </p>
<p>Write a multiple choice question - </p>


<p>Discussion day - Chapter 2: critical info. Studtler - </p>
<p>How was Mary Pickford's role in her family different from the role of women in family at that time? 
	a) She was the breadwinner 
	b) She had more power, say, and status than her husband did
	c) She took care of her mother 
	d) All of the above 
</p>

<p>What's the diff between pedophilic gaze and cultural pedophelia. </p>
<p>Advertisement - tween - suggestion she's naked. You know you're not the first, but do you really care. Pre-owned BMW cars. </p>

<!--<p>Test: 20 m/c, some short answer. 6 prompts for short answer - choose 5 of 6. Each answer worth 5. 5 discrete points for each prompt. Mark first 5 answers. </p>
<p>Representation - understand bigger mosaic. Textbook is in pieces. Postmodernity and poststructuralism. Hard stuff. </p>-->

<img src="http://www.theorycards.org.uk/card05.gif" />

<p>Postmodernism added a serious challenge when it emerged in the 1970s and has shaped the social sciences and humanities. It's an odd subject - broad rubric that includes any number of theories and thinkers under a broad umbrella category. Lots of ideas from theorists. It's often conflated with poststructuralism (especially in angloamerican literature). They overlap but do reference separate things. Heterogenous group. Poststructuralism affected many streams - philosophy, literary theory. Serious debate - poststructuralism vs. marxism. Poststructuralism has a focus on language - discourse and representation. There's no independent reality beyond discourse and representation. At the very basis, according to prostructuralists, we are always held at the surface of representation, and this is where all meaning is made - there's nothing deeper than that. <span class="key">Discourse</span> - expressed in a system of language, including both words and images. A system of representation - it conveys meaning and produces knowledge. "Taking under a discourse of ____" - how power operates through linguistic constructions. The critical piece: <strong>the meaning of a text is always uncertain and unstable</strong>. You can have no definitive reading/truth. There's only many small T truths as opposed to one large bit T truth. </p>
<p>To understand poststructuralism, have to understand structuralism. </p>
<p><span class="key">Postmodernity</span>. Theory cards. Romeo and Juliet - postmodern tape of R+J. Grand theories/ideas get critiqued from within. After modernity or late modernity? Different from PS. PM is a broader category - focus is on representation, not reality. PM is a time period. Post WW2 (or a little later) - prior, people believed in things like scitinfic progress, things would get better, we are slowly climbing, science and technology will get us there. PM - skepticism of universal getting there - but science/tech was evil - nuclear bomb, holocaust. PM was originally used in architecture. </p>
<p><span class="key">Modern architecture</span> - skyscrapers, mass housing, machine asthetic. Postmodern architecture - juxtaposed dichotimies - jumbled it all up - opposites thrown together. Outsides and insides blurring together, old and new. Difficulty of reading architecture. We see images everywhere - our world is just a jumble of things and images - not clear. Postmodernism describes a rejection of art. Modernism was based on the premise that artists had a special gifted standing in society and could use special skills to access hidden truths about the human condition - the impressionists could give you the feeling of the landscape. Postmodernist artists - do not believe it's possible to undercover these deep meanings - we are constantly at the surface, at the level of representation (as opposed to somewhere deeper). <span class="ex"><img src="http://www.artnet.com/WebServices/images/ll1024461llgeJfDrCWBHBAD/barbara-kruger-savoir-cest-pouvoir.jpg" /><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/You_Are_Not_Yourself.jpg" />Barbara Kruger - magazines and advertisements. Taking what she's criticizing and using it in her criticism. Criticizing advertising and womens magazines. You are not yourself. Your body is a battleground. A critique using what it is critiquing. </span>Sociologists and philosophers extended the term to cover all of contemporary society. </p>
<p>Jean Francois Leotard - The Postmodern Condition - book - modern phase of history had given way to postmodernity - because of changes in capitalism. The nature of capitalism was different - capitalism under modernity produced useful things like cars and food. Post modern capitalism produces images. Shift from producing useful things to images. Not because they're useful, but because of their cultural meaning. <span class="ex">Brand shoes. Television. Unboxing videos. <img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4273963727_f2bc24c8d7.jpg" /><img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/smEAAOSwqu9U-Gfe/s-l300.jpg"/>Beer - A Guinness a Day - Guinness is Good for you - early 20th century guinness beer - selling you the product and that it's good for you. Different style - green with envy - not selling a product that is useful/good, if people see you drinking it, they will be jealous. </span></p>
<p>French philopspher Jean Baudrillard - Postmodernist capitalism overproduces images. Reality is always inaccessible. We can never get below an overproduction of images. Perceptions are shaped by television, advertisements, computer screens. Because of tech advances, the X war was exclusively images for Americans - constant bombardment of images. Can never actually get to reality. See 100 images, have a tiny amount of information. Severing between representation and reality. </p>

<p>Last 25 years, post-structuralism. Dash - the post doesn't necessarily mean rejecting structuralism - after structuralism. <span class="key">Semiotics</span> - the reading of signs. <span class="ex">Advertising - semiotics helps us understand that there's a literal meaning and a connotative/implied ucltural meaning. "Green with envy" - is the literal meaning. Green = jealousy. The one is in the center.</span>Read on a number of different levels. Ferdinand Saussure 1913 (death) 2 key points: He wrote his major work and then died on us.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Meaning generated by the structural system of relations - in a system of language, meaning is generated by the entire system of language rather than individually. Meaning doens't adhere to words themselves, but generated through the whole structure of language and relations. Language can be understood and analyzed as part of that structure.</li>
	<li>Saussure questioned that words and signs directly reflect things existing in the real world. <span class="ex">If I say "mouse" - what does it call up? Rodent. </span>No natural connection between "mouse" and that image - between the signifier (word) and the signified (what it calls up). No universal structures to language. NA pigs say "oink oink" but not in other languages - onomatopoeia. Some things don't have direct translations. <span class="ex">Color Wheel - where does red stop and orange begin? Everythnig is blended.</span> In order to make meaning, we need to have tings in the opposites. Language was constructed trhough binary oppositions - cat, dog, mouse - learn relationships between image and word. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="ex">Words associated with masculinity: stoic, strong, dominant, handsome, tall. Femininity - nurturer, beautiful, gentle, petite, fragile, dependant. Opposite. Only in there opposition are they made meaningful. </span></p>

<p>Brought into study of culture - through Clade Levi Strauss. Anthropologist - Structural Anthropology, The Savage Mind. </p>
<ul>Levi-Strauss: 
	<li>Culture is like language. There is a structure/system where everything is made meaningful. </li>
	<li>Universal dimension to culture - possible to find a sset of structures which underlay all cultural systems in humanity. A universal human condition. </li>
</ul>

<p>Comes along Jacques Derrida - "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of Human Scineces" 1966. 'Of Grammatology" - 1967. Song - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNNbJ04167I">Read a page and know what I need to Take apart my baby's heart</a>. The father of deconstruction. End of structuralism. <!-- end here --> In 1966, JD gave a paper called "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of Human Sciences" (kept on talking even though it should only be 20mins). Critique @ Levi Strauss. Argued that you can't understand a text through structural analysis - it gives a false sense of perminence, stability. Nature vs. Culture - some things belong to each - LS - bumped into a wall trying to explain incest taboo - every culture had one, but what it exactly was ranged from culture to culture. This contradiction undermines the entire foundation of structuralism. Through analysis of <span class="key">deconstruction</span> - taking an analysis to pieces. </p>
<ul>6 main pieces of structuralism critique - Of Grammatology - extension of his first paper
	<li>Each sign differs from an endless number of other signs - The complete meaning can never be known. Mouse - changes as we relate it to other words - much more complicated picture in language.</li>
	<li>There is no clear distinction between signifiers and signified (concpept or obejct). Constantly expressing meaning through signifiers. Not like you get anywhere. Threshold of signs. </li>
	<li>Meaning changes as we read and listen. In your thought process, as you keep talking, image keeps morphing. Endless chain. The mouse had its tail cut off, but it was already dead - changes twice. </li>
	<li>The meaning of signs are altered by the signs around them. Not just that the signs are stable, but they're constantly unstable. Can't have an entire structure, because it's always moving/swaying. The meaning in all text is unstable. Under structuralism, everyone should come to the same point/conclusion. But Derrida says it's not possible because the meaning is always moving. Cannot be one undivided stable truth. </li>
	<li>Because any sign is defined by things that it is not, its meaning must depend on its opposites. Rather than language being a stable system, we have instability. La difference - to differ, but also to defer. Texts always hold alternate meanings and always holds its own reputation - always holds another opinion, a way to argue. A definitive and exhaustive interpretation is deferred because we can never get there. Can't ever get to a reality because you're always caught up in an endless chain of signs. The meaning is always deferred. We have signs and language and texts, but no essential truth. We can never get down to the absolute truth. All texts can be read through silcences, line spots, and absences. </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Stuart Hall and how people read pop culture. Hegemonic - reading with the grain. Counterhegemonic - read against the grain. Semiotics, the moral panic (students, milennials). All of these relate to this theory. No questions related to Derrida. </p>
	
<p class="date">Lecture 7: Jan 30, 2018</p>

<p>Cultural production of Images. Our relationship to images. </p>
<p>The Eye: the optic nerve has 18 times more nerve endings than ear. Cones and rods. 1 million different colour combinations. Last sense developed. Constant motion. Eyes are never static. Eyes totally still means you're dead. Two eyes fill in the blind spot where the retina connects to the optical nerve. Brain fills in blind spot. Still capable of 3D Depth. We see less of the spectrum of light. Often fool by sight. If we see but don't know if real, we want to touch it. Eye-witness testimonies that conflict. <!--"I could set this up. I could have someone come in and rob us. I decided not to do that."--> Most believed, but least accurate. Intensity of looks. Eyes communicate stuff. Cultural cliches - eyes are the window to the soul - stare into their soul. Eyes, images, technology. How technology has shaped/changed the way we see things. Tech has developed different means of spreading images - rapid means, so that we can see without being conscious of it. See images of inside of body - x-ray, ultrasound, endoscopes. </p>
<p>Up until 18th century where people believed that the eyes emitted rays - control things with eyes. Still believe in some cultures. Mesmerized. The evil eye - protection against evil eye - charms to protect. Until 1920s - debated whether or not you could move objects w/ your eyes. One side: I could move hanging object with eye. Other side: You can't move objects, but you can move people. Doctor: people might feel uncomfortable. Our culture has become a culture of the eye. That we live in a profoudnly visual world. Visual culture. </p>
<p>Visual culture: the way we see things is affected by what we know and what we believe in. You can have any number of eyewitnesses see the same thing and come up with different testimony. Back then, sight of fire was a symbol of fire. </p>
<p>An ##Image## is a sight has been recreated or reproduced. (Image of marilyn monroe.) An appearance or set of appearances is detached from place and time. Marilyn - this image appears globally, regardless of when it was taken. Images get dislocated from their site of production. They outlast what's representing in them. MM is dead now, yet we have so many images of her that still exist. Images have a life of their own. Photography has dramatically shifted of what we see and the way we see. </p>
<p>Photography and painting. Images before photography opened up the world to images. Before, you had to transport yourself to see the image - to the museum that has the image. The image comes to you. Theorist: Walter Benjamin - what the camera did was destroy the uniqueness of the image. You no longer have one photograph. Internet. Photocopiers. Changed the way we see things and the way we udnerstand the visual world. </p>
<p>EX: How many have seen Mona Lisa? How many have been to the L at the mona lisa? How many was it the first time at the L? Rather than having to go to see it, we see it first on a screen that's surrounded by all of our things. The first time you saw Mona Lisa on TV screen - surrounded by all of YOUR things. Brought to you. Hey, I'd love to see that in real life - then yeah. You saw the copy before original. The original will aways be in reference to the copy you saw. Not that spectacular.</p>
<p>In these travels (internet), the meaning is diversified. In newspaper, "I fell in love so I stole it" then you go - disoriented. When you see it becaus eyou don't see the first image you just saw, you're overwhelmed/disoriented - so many people. Reaction: hold up our camera to reproduce the first image we saw. Our experiences are referring back to images that we saw. </p>
<p>[Leonarrdo Da Vinci's The Rocks] If you haven't seen it before, this will be your first reference. Dislocated from place. Reproduction via posters so you can tkae the image home. A work of art like this is defined by its rarity - only one original - there are lots of copies. John Berger - art is now surrounded by a bogous religiousity - that original works of art take the same status as relics - when people put them on the market/galleries, they make sure they're genuine + ceritified. High art becomes sacred. Other types of visual culture, like porn, are not scared. "You can take a screenshot from a porn and try to sell it." Market Value - assume that someone has a higher market value, then sacred. </p>
<p>[Sexually explicit] Art or porn? Jeff Koons. Famous. "Made in Heaven". Wife - pornstar. "Dirty Ejaculation" Low culture of pornography and high culture of art - blended together - the line doesn't work. Criticism: It is our relaitonship on how we see this that is most profound. The machine change sart. Always conversation between high and low. </p>
<p>Walter dvdmvmvm - with age of camera, art no longer exists in the same way as before. There aren't individual pieces of art, not tied to a specific/sacrred spot/time. Art has become ubiquitous. Art loses its individual power. Technology  + art: this is a good time, a democratization of culture - we don't have to travel to art. Gallery attendance is tied to education level. The idea we lost capital C culture because of democratization doesn't hold true(??) This religiosity is not that art is sacred, but exclusively tied to how much someone would pay for it. Value based on how much something is worth, someeone is willing to pay for it. Capitalistic way of understanding. Jeff Koonts vs. screenshot pornography - the mark of capitalistic value vs. mark of aesthetics - not necessarily higher aesthetic, spiritiual, value. </p>
<p>Our relationship to images is usually tied to words we use around them. Images float freely and change and swift base don how they're introduced to you. [We field with crows - vincent van gogh] This is the last picture Va Gogh painted before he killed himself.  </p>
<p>Lady Gaga - Michel Foucalt. "I was born this way." No, you're a product of power relations." You can take an image and shift its meaning with a few words - Meme. Cats don't speak, but they speak a lot on the internet. User technology - much easier. Internet can shape all of this. Image now illustrates the sentence opposed to sentence capturing image. </p>

<p>Rising gender theory and the gaze <!-- "g a z e" --> Schroeder: "to gaze implies more than to look at - it signifies a psychological relationship of power, in which the gazer is superior to the object of the gaze." The intersection of looking and sexual pleasure. Power relationships - different gazes, different practices of looking. Staring and disability. Casual looking - scanning. Staring - intense. Gazing - not jus tlooking, but it's engaged in power relations. The object of the gaze doesn't necessarily know that they're being looked at. A sense of anonymity. The person doing gazing is in position of power, object doesn't know or is mostly unaware and have less power or no power. Building off of Laura Mulvey - film studies - read from film types of gazing - built from Freudian psychoanalysis - subject and the object - agency vs not - active/male (subject) and passive/female(object). One has a higher status. Subject > object. Freud had a term called ##scopophilia## - pleasure derived from looking at bodies as objects - out of infantile sexuality - mother becomes object of child. Broadens past infant development into the movie theatre - darkness of cinema - gazing - your relationship to the screen - annoying when people chomp, come in late, etc. FAcilitates a condition of looking. In movie house - particular scripts/ideas. Argued that: in film script: active male subjects and the position you are to take on in the film house is the active/male subject, the passive/female object which is the object of pleasure that you watch. Encouraged to identify with the active male subject and see repersentations of women as the passive/female object --> The Male Gaze. Women have turned into images to be looked at. Woman as image. Not just that protagonist is male, bu tthe visual clues set up a male gaze. You take on that male gaze. </p>
<p>John Berger - Ways of Seeing book - "A woman must continually watch herself. She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself." One is supposed to be an object, looking at themselves as if they are the object of the gaze. "Women watch themselves being looked at... Thus she turns herself into an object - and most particularly an object of vision: a sight." In images and film, men act, they are the subjects, women appear, and they are the objects. </p>
<p>Mulvey - two types of gazes: ##Voyeristic## - controlling - sadism, male protagonist gets to be the judge - ascertaing uilt, punish someone, give an act of forgiveness. You see everything, judge someone, but they don't know you're in that position. and ##Fetishistic looking## - In the object, becomes something that could be dangerous and instead becomes reassuring. Castration anxiety. The stiletto - often fetishized - dangeorus object, but sexualizing it makes it reassuring and seductive. Erotic becomes a place of safety. Very controversial - not a lot of female agency, essentialist - drive in biology, that all men will appear this way, and all women appear this way. Deeply heterosexual - what about gay spectators? Is it possible for women to derive pleasure from the male gaze? Formulation is too neat - doesn't account for some of the messiness. Whether or not our tases/ideas/gazing are driven by the producer. You will see things the way producers see them. </p>

<p>Oprah yelling you're all basic. Adorno and Horkheimer (1947) - German theorists - post WW2 - the culture-industry thesis. The frankfurt school - Critical theory. Artists tapped into society - creative geniuses - could see into society. They rejected this idea. culture is not the creation of artisans. Culture is a commodity produced through an industrial process of mass production - sounds like Marx. They're marxists. The products of culture reflect only the logic of profit. All of culture is simply designed to make a profit. To make a profit, needs to be easily reproduced and fairly standard - basic. Standardiztion have to fit the modes of production. Produce for everyone, not individuals. Easier to mass produce clothing a set number of sizes and fit into them instead of getting it measured, custom made. Easier to sell lot sof tihngs at a low price than tailro to individuals. Culture becomes something bought and sold - a commodity. Reality TV - Kim Kardashian - what is she famous for? She's famous for being famous. She is herself, a commodity. Cultural production is marked by superifcial novelty. She was preceded by Paris Hilton. Essential repetition - things need to be different enough to spark consumption but not so different to be challenging. Sweaters - sort sweaters - baggy, chunky, cardigan, etc. They're just small changes. Needs to keep selling us stuff. Minor things to get us to buy more. Down in economy, lipstick sales go up - cheap small thing - you can make a new look. </p>
<p>Reality TV - new season of the Bachelor - I wonder if anything will be different. Rom Coms. Girl bands/boy bands. Big machine. The values we all hold are only the values of capitlaism. Important: accumulation of watlh, spendign as a sign of status, financial status is equivalent of human value. Creepy thing: people who are beautiful in contemporary ways often have attributes s being kinder, being better employees. It mines folk culture and high culture and mines them to pieces - destroys them. </p>
<p>People say: this is really elitist. That you can buy your way into culture. Too deterministic. Elitist frontL: it will take great thinkers/people to rip people out of this thing. But maybe people are happy with this. Are we all dupes? If you derive pleasure from it, then who is it to say you're a udpe in the machine? </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 8: Feb 1, 2018</p>
<p>Production of Popular Culture + Nicki Minaj. </p>
<p>Nicki Minaj Music Videos. [Nicki Minaj - Anaconda, SuperBass]  </p>
<p>Article - short references to theory. Text - bigger issues around production. Article - production of identity, and production of people.</p>

<p>Black female artists - lifespan of 2 years. Production of Nicki Minajs' identity. She's managed to outlast many women that have come before her. Relationship with Barbie. Diversification of Barbie dolls - the ideal, original barbie, everything is just a variation off of her. Barbie is designed after a German Sex doll, created into a child's toy. Women have reclaimed the word "bitch" - but not really. Politics of words - insider/outsider context - friend callign you a bitch vs. outsider. Is reclamation empowering? Girl power, wear a tube top - is it power or feeding into the system? Barbie - system puts women at a disadvantage, looks, not good at math. Stereotyping. Makes women conform to beauty standards - but you can do anything with them. Producers don't match what consumers do with it. Deface Barbie, or played with barbie with a script that Mattel did not want. Nicki Minaj - big booty - not standard Barbie. Record Companies - a thread that works - just have to follow that one thread - the formula that works - is she part of that formula or is it her own talent? Shifting image vs. playing into it. RIpping heaad off teeth - ozzy osbourne rips head of bat off - freakshow - geek performers - rip heads off of things as a part of their performance. Nicki is also shaming skinny bitches - opposing rather than empowering - skinny-shaming. But it doesn't displace the profoundness of thinness- attacks it but doesn't displace it. Bratz dolls. Ok to call yourself bitch, but not ok to call yourself barbie. Minaj - why can't I? What's so wrong. Postmodern reading - nicki minaj - fabricated this identity to play off of all of these issues - race, gender, sexuality - she's in control even though she's part of the machine. Who has the power in pop culture?</p>

<p>##The Culture Industry Thesis## - a slightly different variation of a formula. Lady Gaga - madonna, david bowie. A machine that spits out modestly different things. Totalizing - reading backwards, just finding similarities - finding connections. "They're the new X" Reading backwards vs. forwards. Culture is standardized. Clothing. Fashion can't cycle too quickly because people will still have the clothes - has to cycle slow enough so you can decide to throw out current clothes. Celebrity Culture - is different now - market has changed - rather than just selling the film, all of material goods that go with it. Wider market of stuff - an obsession. Artists play off of old songs. Copyrighting - sampling, etc. Keeps lawyers busy. </p>
<p>We are all dupes of this culture machine vs. no. We know what they're doing, but doesn't mean we enjoy it. Adventure Time - everything repeats over and over again, but no one lives long enough to learn anything. Generatiional change - Vanilla Ice - Under Pressure - horrific thing generation had done to music vs. this is the greatest thing. Easier to conform. Geek culture - wasn't cool before, now appropriated. We have to conform. How do you step outside of the machine. Can you drop out of consumer culture/society? Even if you try to take  yourself out, you're still proving the original point. Are things being popular because we enjoy them, or because they want us to enjoy them? Is it what we want or what they want we want? Not just the machine pushing out stuff, others will say they will demand and producers will react. Nicki Minaj fans pushed for barbie for her. Consumer backlash, advocacy. Is it top down or in conversation. </p>
<p>American culture comes up here, but some things aren't allowed. Madonna pretending masturbating on stage - toronto police banned. Superhero movies - started out for late youth, now for children - onesies for infants. CocaCola opening up the market to 3 year olds. </p>
<p>We like what we're familiar with. </p>
<p>Opening new markets - uniformity - body ideals, etc. Big Western media pushes outwards. Dove - soap - black women to white woman - colonialism - racism. It wasn't until consumers pushed back did they realize. Anne McClintock - commodity racism - how racism gets carried through goods - soap. LGBTQ in media, but others will say that they're pushing to a new market, publicity. Corporations are not require to care, only respoinsible for making money. </p>
<p>Production needs consumers. </p>
<p>It's not just there, it's a message. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 9: Feb 6, 2018</p>
<p>Consumerism. Consumption. </p>
<p>5 essential things. </p>
<p>Last week - Western eyes for asians surgery. 40 min documentary. We have these standards that are natural, historical. We're caught up in these power relationships. </p>
<p>WE are all experts of consumerism.</p>

<ol>Thinking
	<li>Historically specific - the world existed prior to consumer culture. In the 18th century developing, full shape beginning of 20th century. Before this, people had much closer relationships to the things they consumed because they were involved witht he production. Distanced the production from the consumption. Hard to think differently, hard to think about producing own stuff. %%Tomato on a pizza - production of it. When you do something yourself, you also attach more value to it. If you grow your own tomatoes, you're not gonna wanna sell them for 1.99 a lbs - sweat blood and tears. Had to fight rats, raccoons, squirrels. %% Because of the nature of where things are grown and shipped from, tomatoes have to be picked far before they're ripe. It is very different. </li>
	<li>What and how we consume has a broader social significance. - If looking at consumerism in strict terms, we'd only look at the exchange. But that's not all of consumerism. Have to go through production, exchange, and goods with you. Broader chain of signification. </li>
	<li>We live in a world where we often talk about consumer choice and that consumers want choices. Individual decisions are guided by larger social structures. Around consumption - social class. Class distinction.</li>
	<li>Look at consumption rooted in specific sites and ... It's not wholly guided by social structures. You can decide what to consume and what not to consume. Just because you buy, doesn't mean you're going to wear it as they designed it. You can put holes, paint it. There's still some sense of agency. </li>
	<li>There's a larger cost to consumerism - social and environmental. Born unevenly. Dif people bear the runts of the costs. </li>
</ol>

<p>[The Tate Modern] - An art installation. The art is the crack in the floor. Began at western entrance under a garbage can and spread east. Dolores Salcedo - Shibiluh - a word that is pronounced in a way that distinguishes one group or one class from another. comes from the bible - enemies - forced to say the word, but it's not in their dialect. Anyone who can't say it, gets murdered. It's a word that speaks to power and the power to judge. It's not unintended that it starts at west ot east. It's also about coloonialism and racism. Artist statement: the history of ... is postmodernism. This building of a society required widespread exploitation. Salcedo is considered a ##post-colonial artist##. How did she so it? Mystery. Important point: much like the process of imperialism and colonilazation, even after the show closed, the crack would be need to filled in. There will always be a scar that remains. </p>

<p>##Cultural appropriation## - take a piece of a culture thats not your own, and tke it on. The original thing you're appropriating is still being marginalied. Using it for aesthetic reasons and ignoring significant original values. Stripping it of its meaning and bringing it into your own culture/being for aesthetic reasons. Appreciation vs. Appropriation. Taken out of its culture and commodified. Commodofication and power. Taking out of its original context. Caught up in power relations. Call it culture industry - sexy and fun out of the expense of other people. </p>
<p>Example: Headdress - music festival, victoria secret fashion show. Not any way related to Indigenous people. Sexualization, exoticization - you can appropriate something from a culture to become more exotic. </p>

<p>This is all falls under ##Post-colonialism##. Emerges in writing in the late 1980s. The relationship and the rest. A morphus of theory. Focused on discource. Representation, what's represented and the deeper power structures behind them. Colonialism isn't over. When you say post colonial, you're not talking about after colonialism. It's interested in the scar of the crack. How it continues to haunt the present. Colonialism - vast - historians estimate over 3/4 have had their lives shaped by colonialism. Manipulated traditional powers of authority. Relationships. Altetered exsting social and cultural patterns. Talking about politics, economics, society and culture. Sactionted the spread of Europeans throughout the world on economic an dcultural grounds .Their push for control over the world. They were arguing that they were securing strategic trade groups, to evangelicize (religious beliefs to save peoples souls), to deal with the issue of overpopulation and disperse unwated people. From late 18th-19th century - defined by ideas of race that were emerging. Race is the child of racism, not the father. Scientific discovery of race because of racism - the need to justify race. This idea that emerges - idea that white people are biologically superior. Not true at all. Belief that white people have to be parents to other races - so evolved that all of the other races were like children. It was the responsibility of white europeans to teach civilization and to spread christinaianity. The ##white man's burden## - the idea that white people wre burdened by the fact that they needed to spread civilization, that this was their duty. Picked up by advertising, spread ##Commodity racism## (Ann McClintock). Unlike scientific racism (almost no one could read those), with mass consumerism, you could spread all of these ideas really quickly in images - you dont need to be literate to understand images. Globally, reahc massses of people. Commodity Racism - difference, power, and consumption at the intersection of imperialism and industrialism. Peopl eare saying we need to spread the white doctrine all over the world, you have increasing production, so you also need to sell things - brings together two things - civilize + sell. %%Pear soap - left: colonial official. The first step to lightening the white mans burden is to teach cleanliness-  dark corners of the earth. The ideal toilet. No natural connection between soap cleanliness and civilization. Can spread civilization through cleanliness. Cleanliness is godliness. Irony: pear, palm olive soap were extracted in colonial places, brought to brtish and sell back. Right: two children. white and black child. White - parental role. White child bathing to black child, black childs body turns white. <!--Did one of you just swear? I love you guys. --> Holds the hierarchy of races - child can never become white, never equal. %% Soap becomes a common household good because of advertising. Queen Elizabeth I - took a bath once a month whether she needed it. Too clean - weakening body. </p>

<p>##Orientalism## - name of a book by Edward Said. Opposite of Orient - oxidant. Look at how the west were constructed as superior. Anything beyond west is inferior. East is the Other. A product of culture, not from history. Essentialism - essential differences that's assigned by history/biology was actually a product of culture. Argues that the west fabricated the Orient. the orient is a consturction of the west, and part of the imagination. It exists in people's minds. Literature, politics, etc, advertising, consumerism. In the creation of Oriented Other, a whole set of values gets attached to the EAst that are dichotomous of the set of value sof WEst. These dichotamous were productive as opposed to descriptive. What values were associated with the west: individualism vs. collectivism. Capitalism, autonomy. People tend to think of the east in terms of cruelty, sensuality, laziness, terror - all stereotypes. Otherness turns people into the masses, not individuals. Exotic, mystical, seductive. East: feminine. West: masculine. Carpets, tapestries, Haram pants. GEishas, come play with me. Apple - forbidden fruit. Airfrance. She's seductive, mysterious. "Come play me, be a lord over all. Submissive, she'd be dominated. Stereotypical notions ithat she's sexual. Makeup color names. People want diversity in food, but not the people. </p>
<p>Exoticism speaks to status. 1) can appropriate it and leave it - privilege of whiteness - you can dabble and leave. 2) You can signal your social class. Lots of people went to India to find themselves. </p>
<p>[The Fashion Oriental] - rich colours, silks, gold jewelry, sun umbrella, all get mashed together and lose their specificity. </p>
<p>The conspcious consumption - Does she have high or low status of wealth? High. Floresteen Bevelein - ##Conspicious consumption## - wasted consumption. It was excessive. Consumption wasnt for practical reasons, it wasn't necessary. It was consumption beyond what you eneded for wellbeing. You had increased incomes in the period along with increased leisure time and marketing was good. People began to consume in ways that were obvious, noticeable, visible in order to signal a social distinction. Class status was at a particular level. What you can consume vs. inheritance. Reflection on your status with cash and finance. Signal your identity and class status through various consumer goods. It has a purpose - to send signs around distinction. %%Cars - Tesla - can you afford a X. Tech devices. Jewelry, accessories, clothing. Watches. Coffee. Shoes. tV. Bags. Buy into trends. Huge collections %%</p>
<p>This is all a reflection of taste. When we talk about taste, we talk about social class. Do you have good taste? Everything is permissible as long as it's done in good taste. Always about class. Burgeiroir - Huge study of the french middle class - are we all snobs? The idea that your taste is good taste and that everyone else's taste is bad taste is part o a class system. Book. Distinction. Howe we build distinctions between ourselves and between classes. The condition of being set apart as different and special. In popu culture, achieve distinction through your purchases. You can show valeu and good taste through good purchases. You understand value. Because evrythnig thinks their taste is good, that theycan judge. Doesn't follow that the working class appreciate middle class taste. Working class: keep your culture. Even working class are snobs - they appreciated own culture and didnt need middle classes. </p>

<p>Sex/Gender: confusing language. Historically, the word was always "sex". Two boxes - 1 or the other. In 1950s, psychiatrists came up with the word ##Gender## - separate biology from the cultural. Sex refers to biology and gender refers to culture. Cultural sex roles - socialization, media - what sex means in terms of performance of it. Butler: This is garbage. </p>
<p>Judith Butler: Gender trouble (1990). A landmark text. Dismiss her because it's too much of a mind bend. Destabilize/take apart this dichotomy around the body. Thnk critically about the body itself. They're descriptions but are productive. They're not describing something that actually exists, they actively constitute it. The categories of gender and sexuality - the results of a performativity of gender. When you perform gender, this produces the look of gender. WE usually think: you are gender, you perform it. No, we perform gender to give the appearance of gender. </p>
<p>Won award for worst writer in academy. </p>
<p>199 Gender must also designate the very apparatus of production whereby the sexes themselves are established It's not added on after. It's the very essence of how sex gets produced. The distinction of sex and gender is false. Every time we talk about sex, we are automatically talking about gender as well. Gender is not to culture as sex is to nature. Think of a child - a child that has a full identity. Think of them without sex. Can you think of a sexless child. "What is it?" "I'm hoping for a litter of kittens." It's so foundational that you can't think beyond it. The body in that formulation can't exist without the cultural production of it. It's established as prediscursive - there's sex and society layers stuff onto it, but we assume that there's a foundation that exists (but for Butler, that's a no) - there's no separaation. You can't have something that exists as foundational. Culture is formative, productive, it's not merely descriptive. </p>
<p>how does gender get created. </p>
<p class="center">acts, gestures, and desire produce the effect of an internal core or substance, but produce this on the surface of the body, through the play of signifying absences that suggest, but never reveal, the organizing principle of identity as a cause. Such acts, gestures, enactments, generally construed, are performative in the sense that the essence or identity that they otherwise purport to express are fabrications manufactured and sustained through corporeal signs and other discursive means. That the gendered body is performative suggests that it has no ontological status apart from the various acts which constitute its reality. This also suggests that if that reality is fabricated as an interior essence, that very interiority is an effect and function of a decidedly public and social discourse, the public regulation of fantasy through the surface politics of the obdy, the gender border control that differentiates inner from outer, and so institutes the "integrity" of the subject.  </p>
<p>these acts, gestures, desires produce the effect of this core, an identity. You produced the appearnce of a gender through all of these performances. She diagrees with people who say: I have this interior essence, so I project my interior essence outwards. She says that this relationship doesn't exist. It's not that the outside expresses something inherent to your core, it's that the performative of gender creates that core. For Butler, gender is always performative. All of these signs of gender are also interrupted. It's not that you have a unified, stable gender identity, through performances, we have lapses and interruptions. No solid, stable core. </p>
<p>It's odd that you look at one part of a baby and announce that part to the world. That moment isn't a descriptor of that child's essence, it's bringing them into this world of the performance of gender. </p>
<p>[Judith Butler: Your Behaviour Creates Your Gender] - Produces a series of effects. WE act and speak in ways that consolidate an impression of being a man or a woman. Act like being man/woman is a fact about us. It's a phenomenon that is reproduced all the time. Nobody really is a gender from the start. Sissy boys, Tomboys - difficult to function socially. Without being teased, suffering violence, without parents itnervening - why can't you be normal. There are institutional powers and informal practices like bullying. Gender is policed. Gender is culturally formed, but also a domain of agency/freedom. It's most important to resist violence. "We're all born naked, and the rest is drag." </p>
<p>Drag - one of the performances that reveals how gender is constituted in everyone. We consolidate an impression of gender through thiese constant and incessive that gets policed. EE Toy stores (pink and blue), dress code EE</p>
<p>Stable, interior core is a fabrication of gender itself. </p>
<p>Under conditions of normative heterosexuality, policing gender is sometimes used as a way of securing heterosexuality. It all forms a matrix, an appearance, of a stable gender core. When you police gender, you're also policing sexuality. </p>
<p><img src="https://binarythis.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/b1.png?w=584&h=822" />Repeated performance of gender that gives a stable identity. Process maks us think there's a natural inner truth. Gender is ideological - gets naturalized an normalized. <img src="https://binarythis.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/b2.png?w=584&h=820" />A coherent pattern - when you say "sex" and someone says "it's a boy!". People are gonna show up with baseball, trucks, etc. When they imagine his marriage: a woman. This is the pattern that gets set from the beginning. As soon as you talk about sex/gender, you get pulled into that pattern. Gender is a doing, not a being. There is no doer behind the deed. Identity is an effect/product, not a cause. Drag reveals how gender gets produced as an effect. If you did not know they were a drag artist, you would not label it as drag, it would just be male/female to you. In these acts of repititon, there are interruptions, in these interruptions we can have freedom/agency. Gender could be made to be less violent. System we have now produces violence against people who are non-conforming. </p>

<p>Much of Butler's work rests on Michel Foucalt. </p>

<p>When we speak of something: it's not merely description, it is constitutive. When we name/describe something, we are creating the thing of which we speak. History of prison, sexuality. For Foucalt, modern society is based on a certain type of power - a power that is hard to see. It is almost everywhere and seemingly seems to be nowhere. The panopticon - ideal prison - center is a cylo for warden. Mor eeffective and efficient way to ensure people are well disciplined because the prisoner can't tell where the warden's looking - have to presume at any point the warden is looking. You can have 1 warden and any number of prisoners. This works for society in general because we internalize surveillance - we self-surveil - modify and regulate our behaviou rin order to be docile. EESecurity cameras. People taking photos/videos everywhere.EE Visibility is a trap. Even in architecture. Produce docile bodies - easy to govern. We internalize discipline. We submit to a normalizing judgment - not just watch, but to correct behaviour - we all anticipate and work to correct our behaviour because we know someone higher than us is analyzing and judging our behaviour. Called all of this ##the society of normalization##. All of society gets pulled into these particular norms (esp norms around the body). Before 1850, the word normal meant perpendicular. After 1850, iti is a standard to capture most people, everyone just wants to be normal - it's something to be. Difference between ideals vs. normals - ideal is what you look up to, but normal is what you're supposed to be. </p>
<p>All of these places arent just surveillance, it's whre we build ppower and knowledge. Every time we have power, we're building knowledge. Every time we have knowledge, we're building power. Inseperable. In know we control, in controlling we know. Brought to study of sexuality.</p>
<p>Peole have idea: in victorian past, people were very uptight. No one talked about sex, it was behind closed doors. Follow period of repression with libteration - Foucalt says no. ##Repressive Hypothesis##. Foucalt says sex is the secret we are doomed to speak about forever. Argues that the Victorians were obsessed with sex. They talked about it constantly- a veritable discursive explosion. Rather than silence, there's a constant discussion. Talking about regulating, criminalizing, making it disordered is also talking about sex. Even if negative, still speaking about it. In criminal courts, doctors, lawyers - agencies of power are constantly talking about sex. KnowledgE+power - in constantly talking about sex, expressing power. Constructing that which they are speaking as opposed to describing. Aroudn 1870, that homosexuality is invented. You have proliferation of discourses. People are talking about homosexuality. They think they're discovering it, but they're actually inventing it. The invention of homosexuality is the invention of an identity based on homosexuality. The homosexual is invented as a different species - deemed to be abnormal.  </p>
<p>Sex becomes something that has to be administered. has to be carefully regulated and controlled. EESchools - schools are divided by gender. Administrators and teachers were worried about layout of desks and dorms - sex was a problem. EE Private business become social/political problem. Amount of space between students - can't have touching. </p>
<p>4 particular areas that become critical in explosion of discourse: </p>
<ul>
	<li>female fecundity (the hysterical woman) - female fiertility. Concerned about hysterical woman - infection of uterus and need to get pregnant to fix it. Based on old science. A woman's womb could wander around her body, that it wasn't fixed. Womb was infecting her brain. If want it to stay put, need to be pregnant. Women become hysterical, concernn about reproduction. All of this discource about women's health, sanity, what to do with insane women, how to have proper reproduction, how to cure this. Defining normal by defining what it is not. </li>
	<li>infantile sexuality (the masturbating child) - male children worried about. Wouldnt talk about female children masturbating - taboo. Semen represented an essential being/energy that could not be wasted. It was valuable, precious, in limited supply so you had to save it untily ou could have proper sex. Boys masturbating - got sickly, weak, waste. Invented contraptions to wear </li>
	<li>'deviant' sexualityies (the Mathulsian couple) - how do you ensure the right people are having the right type of sex? The middle class, married, heterosexuality. And not using birth control.</li>
	<li>sex crimes (the homosexual) - gets defined in this period. Rendered to be a mental illness. Rendered illegal. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this saying it's illegal produces the identity.</p>
<p>Also points out: doctors have rising amounts of power as interpretors of the body. People go to doctor when need help, and doctors use patients records to publish/create new knowledge. A new confessional - confess sins - doctors label/diagnose, use that material to come up with bigger categories. Intrsection of pwoer and knowledge. </p>

<p>Butler uses this formulation. We're all involved in that in the production of binaries of gender. </p>
<p>You can never have a body without culture. Some perform inline with the system that rewards us and some perform out of line. </p>

<p>2 poles on identity theory - essentialist and social constructivism. </p>
<p>Not unique to Egypt. "The Perfect Vagina" documentary. </p>
<p>Simulacrulum - Beaurillard. The hymen has no place - a copy of a copy. </p>

<p>[The Perfect Vagina] Hate their vagina. Impress men. Women have become more aware of what's available - doesn't mean they know what's normal. Labiaplasty. Sex and the City - Brazilian wax. They don't look like real women. </p>
<p>Filmmaker sees vaginal surgery as a problem. People are trying to modify their body to match other people's expectations. Is this type of surgery a reflection of a fake identity? Doesn't have to reflect true, stable identity - dying your hair. Are you being who you're not? Person vs. Person as an image. YOu mature out of a greater understanding of a range of bodies as opposed to media broadcasting. Whether or not you see btheir bodies as a true reflection of themselves. </p>
<p>Question of identity grew to be a question of modernity. It was a question about a soul - dif than a question of identity. Whether you have a true identity core or does the body shape that identity more profoundly. Cultural specificity - some less of a labia, some elongate. Loss of nerve endings, complications. </p>

<p>Hymenoplasty - blood from natural hymen smells sweet, different. Doesn't work scientifically, yet its the essential measure of virginity. Virginity is essential. Double standard. Popping sound. Certificates. Even though doctors couldn't tell. </p>
<p>Purity balls in America - tween girls, public ritual - promise theyll be virgins until marriage, get purity rings from father. </p>
<p>Hymen becomes a copy of something that never existed - simulacaram. Choice takes away respectability. </p>
<p>REspectability and virginity. Public/private divide - some things so taboo we can't speak/teach it. </p>

<p>Whether or not you think identities are stable or constantly moving and in flux. When you look in the mirror, do you see a stable identity. Do you know who you are when you look in the mirror? </p>
<p>Identity and geography. Is virginity prized or something you need to lose. Language. </p>
<p>We assume children are heterosexual, yet we also assume children aren't sexual. They have to be asexual and heterosexual. </p>
