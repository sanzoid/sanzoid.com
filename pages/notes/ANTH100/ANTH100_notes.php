<h1>What is Anthropology?</h1>

<p>Anthropology is the integrated study of human nature, human society and the human past. The study of humanty in all times and all places. Answer the question: what it means to be human. Taking things that are unfamiliar, and making them familiar. Taking things that are familiar, and making things unfamiliar. Very broad discipline. Social science. </p>

<p>Biology, Philosophy, Sociology, Political Science, History, Psychology, etc. all study human nature. </p>

<ul>The Anthropological Perspective
	<li><span class="list">Holistic</span> - Studies the complex whole. Not just one aspect. </li>
	<li><span class="list">Comparitive</span> - make comparisons of different societies. Not a good idea to make generalizations if you only know about your own society. <span class="ex">Marriage is between 1 man and 1 woman. Look at other cultures. Ghosts may get married. Humans offer a lot of variations. Not the case where only one is natural. </span></li>
	<li><span class="list">Field-based</span> - Data-collection. Go to where the study is. </li>
	<li><span class="list">Evolutionary</span> - Strive to make generalizations that are valid over space and time. How humans have evolved. </li>
</ul>

<p>Demonstrate the separation between biological evolution and cultural evolution. People used to think they were the same thing. <span class="ex">Black people are not as smart as white people. Women not as smart as men. Proven to be not true.</span></p>

<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>A set of learned behaviours that you learn from society. Some learned excplicitly, some learned implicitly. We use culture to adapt to our world and to transform it. The thing that has had the greatest impact on us as organisms and everything else. Very little the human culture doesn't touch. Unique to humans. No other species have anything like it. We're more dependant on learned behaviour. We are born with no instincts to survive. <span class="ex">Giraffe is born, stands up. Human is born, useless.</span> We have a long period of learning before we become adults. So many things to learn that human growth is suppressed. We should be reaching physical maturity around 8 or 9. Childhood is longer among humans because of culture. Humans are <span class="key">bio-cultural</span> organisms - both biology and culture. Biology is what makes us capable of culture. Survival as biological organisms has come to depend on culture. We can no longer survive in the wild. Biology has been affected by culture. </p>

<h2>Biological Anthropology</h2>
<p>Human beings as living organisms. Started in the 19th century in the study of human physical variation. Used to measure physical differences in people - Physical anthropologists - goal was to classify people with races. Ended up proving that race as a scientific category doesn't exist, it's a cultural thing. They are labels invented by people in power.</p>
<p>Now more interested in <span class="key">Primatology</span>, <span class="key">Paleoanthropology</span> - fossilized homanide remains, <span class="key">Human skeletal biology</span> - bones, skeletal remains, <span class="key">Molecular anthropology</span> - cells, DNA from fossilized neanderthal. </p>
<p>What makes humans similar and different from one another and other species.</p>
<h2>Archaeology</h2>
<p>Archaeology - Specializes in the study of past human cultures. Data obtained from material remains and not living. Mmay work closely with historians and other speciailists with the analysis. </p>
<p>Linguistic Anthropology - We are language users. Other species don't have languages, only have communication systems. Study the ways that language correlates with gender, race, ethnicity, class, etc. Linguistic is intertwined with Cultural. </p>

<h2>Cultural Anthropology</h2>
<p>Cultural Anthropology (Social/Ethnology/Socio-cultural) - Study culture - learned behaviours. Closest to sociology. Interested in all members of society. Social organization, gender, religion, marriage, kingship, etc. Distinct by their methods - data is collected in an extended period of field work - <span class="key">participant observation</span> - attempt to live in the culture for a year. Speak to <span class="key">Informants</span> to compile data. <span class="key">Ethnography</span>  - description of a way of life by the people. ##Ethnology</span> - comparison of two or more groups of poeple. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 2: May 3, 2017</p>

<h1>Interdisciplinary</h1>
<h2>Applied Anthropology</h2>
<p>You can do it from any division or combine them. Subfield where the anthropologist uses insights from any combination of subfields to arrive at a solution to everyday problems. <span class="ex">There were no razors for women. Applied anthropologists helped Gilette create the first women's razor. </span></p>
<h2>Medical Anthropology</h2>
<p>Studying human health. Biological and cultural anthropology. Critical medical anthropology - take local health issues and link to larger social, economic processes. Colonialism - disease just doesn't occur because of pathogens - could be due to inequality, lack of access to healthcare, lack of access to clean water. Politiciszing issues of health and illness.</p>

<h1>Uses of Anthropology</h1>
<p>Cope with cultural differences. Question the rightness of our own ways of doing something - not starting from the assumption that the way we do tings is right. </p>
<p>Diispell bigoted stereotypes. </p>

<h1>Chapter 3 </h1>
<h2>Evolutionary Theory</h2>

<p>Living species can change over time to give rise to new species. Common ancestry of living organisms. Not just a theory. </p>
<ul>Evidence for Evolution: Change over time
	<li>$$Change over time$$ - fossil record. Found fossilized species that didn't modernly exist. Biological variation. They had to explain the past. </li>
	<li>$$Change over space$$ - Darwin. why does variation exist among living organisms. Variation over space. Finches looked very different on the Galapagos Island - species could change and adapt to different habitats. </li>
</ul>
<p>What did people think before Darwin? </p>
<p>First records - Ancient Greek. People thought the world was ageless - it always existed and it is always going to exist. Others thought that the world was created recently and will end very soon. ##Essentialism## (Plato) - everything in the world is a copy of an ideal world. Every imperfect example in our world had an essence of the perfect thing in the ideal world. All things in the world with the same essence belonged to the same "natural kind."</p>
<p>Aristotle - believed all of the natural kinds could be organised on a continuum: simple to complex.</p>
<p>Judeo-Christian - there must be a greater being. There are no gaps. Made it the ##Great Chain of Being##. They made it a hierarchy - only God is perfect. Humans have souls and material bodies - in the middle. There was no other way to talk about it.</p>
<p>Challenged. Georges Cuvier - anatomist - first excavations. Discovered only 4 major categories of living things. He couldn't find anything else like the fossil species he found. Found that some species weren't always there. Periods of extinction and speciations - revolutions (translated to catastrophe) -> ##Catastrophism##. Probably large-scale natural disasters. Idea that a species would disappear was radical - because there was only one creation to Essentialists. If there was no connection between the 4, then what is the chain? </p>
<p>Idea of intelligent design - a benevolent creator created these species. ##Uniformitarians##. New species appear, but they're also God's creations. The world changes, but it's by design. They disagreed that extinctions happen. They didn't think that God would allow extinction. Charles Lyell - Use understanding how erosion works to understand what the earth looked like in the past. Interested in how old the earth is. </p>
<p>Catastrophist - accept that harmony was occassionly badly disrupted. Sometimes extinctions need to happen. Uniformitarian - events were unfolding according to God's laws. </p>
<p>##Transformational Evolution## Lamarck tried to figure out what could account for all of these theories. He was totally wrong. Wanted to believe the world was harmonious, but couldn't explain extinction - how could perfect creatures become extinct? People said it was because of a flood. But water creatures were also fossilized. Some people thought some were hunted by forebearers. Other people thought they moved somewhere else and we never found them yet - but this was becoming unlikely. He thought maybe the fossil animals are the forebearers. There were changes in the environment, they adapted, passed to descendants, they changed. It's a changing world - Transformational Evolution. Each species transforms into another. He proposed two laws: 1. Organs are strengthened by use and weakened by disuse - use it or lose it. 2. Inheritance of acquired characteristics. <span class="ex">Ex: Giraffes. Plant food on the ground was becoming scarce. Food was only in trees. They kept stretching necks.</span> If you dye your hair green, you can't pass that on. This doesn't work. But it paved the way for Darwin. </p>
<p>Natural Selection. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace. Wallace was an amateur naturalist. Theorized that a given species over time could give rise to species. Over how much time? Archbishop Usher - 9am on Oct 23 4004 BC. Lyell disagreed because of erosion studies - hundreds of thousands - wrong but right idea. Actually 4.5 billion years old. Darwin - </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 3: May 5, 2017</p>

<p>##Natural Selection## - best explanation that we have to account for biological variation. Every generation naturally has variation. The variants that are better adapted to the nevironment survive longer. This causes change in a species over time as qualities are preferentially passed on. To this view, ther is no essence to species. There is no "humanness," it's just all variation that is all-changing all the time. Have to think about it at a population-level, not individual-level. Lamarck - individual giraffes. Darwin - all giraffes - some giraffes naturally have longer necks - will survive longer with more offspring. Thomas Malvis had this idea that population increases geometrically but resources only increase arithmetically. Early on, not enough resources. Competition for resources so some variants get them and others don't. Those that don't survive, don't breed. ##Survival of the fittest##. </p>
<ul>Darwin's rules
	<li>No two individuals are identical</li>
	<li>Traits are inherited. Offspring resemble their parents.</li>
	<li>Natural selection</li>
</ul>
<p>Aptation - any kind of feature than an organism has, no matter where they got it from. Adaptation - any useful feature that has been shaped by natural selection. Exaptation - a feature that was originally shaped by natural selection and then it's useful for another thing. <span class="ex">Wings on insects were not originally shaped for flying. They were for cooling down. When they became big enough, they became useful for fluttering then flying. </span> </p>
<p>##Biological fitness## - how many offspring do you have. </p>
<p>Main problem with Darwin's theory: no one could explain how heredity worked. People knew traits were passed on, but they don't know how.</p>

<h3>Heredity</h3>
<p>##Pangenisis## - everybody is made up of particles. The particles from each parent merges and gives to child. If child gets more hair particles from father, then hair will be more like father's. </p>
<p>Gregor Mendel - plant breeding experiments with peas. He noticed that pea plants - red flowers + white flowers =/= pink flowers. 2nd generation- 3:1. There is no blending. There's only one particle and every parent just passes just one. ##Co-dominant## trait - equally expressed trait. The particles were ocurring in pairs. Each individual gets one from each parent - ##Principle of Segregation##. When the embryo is formed, the pairs of particles are independently sorted - they come together at random in the offspring. But no one paid attention to it for 35 years. </p>
<p>New science: ##Genetics##. ##Homozygous## - the same trait from each parent. Blue eyes are recessive. Nothing else to express. Different particles - ##Heterozygous##. ##Genes## - particles. </p>
<p>Often more than two variants to a particular gene. ##Allele## - all the diferent possible variants of a trait. <span class="ex">Eye color: blue, brown, green, etc. </span> All chromosomes came in pairs. </p>
<p>Cells have to different kinds of celll stuff - ##mitosis## - when cells make copies of themselves. ##meiosis## - when dividing, chromosomes obey Mendelian principles. The chromosomes are segregated and independently sorted. A gene has a position in a chromosome. Some traits only appeared if other traits were present - linked traits, passed on together. Part of a chromosome can break off and attach to another - crossing over. </p>
<p>They used to think that genes perfectly mapped to traits. Happens in simple cases. ##Polygenetic## traits - governed by many genes. Continuum. <span class="ex">Skin colour.</span>##Pleiotropy## - just one gene that affects many traits. <span class="ex">Sickle-cell Anemia - Genetic condition. Affects red blood cells. Increases resistance to Malaria and decreases amount of oxygen carried in red blood cells. Two copies - fatal. One copy - good.</span>Genes undergo ##Mutation## - a new allele appears. Explained how variation exists. Inheritance can be unchanging, but mutations are totally random. Evolution is directionless. Mutations don't occur because organisms need them. Sometimes they can be good, neutral, or bad. Sometimes mutations are fatal. Lamarck was wrong - you can't modify yourself and pass it down. </p>
<p>They still didn't understand the structure of chromosomes. DNA - deoxyfodjfsfjsd acid. Chromosomes are made of large molecules of DNA. Double helix. 4 bases. Before mitosis, unzip, complementary line up, reform. Mutations - changes in the structure of DNA. </p>
<h3>Genotype vs Phenotype</h3>
<p>Molecular structue can differ from how it is expressed. ##Genotype## - what's there in the DNA. ##Phenotype## - what's observable in the actual organism. <span class="ex">G: has 1 red and 1 white. P: it's red. </span>Geno can say one thing but Pheno is expressed another way. Phenotype is just what happens. Organisms can affect their own environments - ##Niche construction## <span class="ex">It's too cold. I'm moving.</span> Create different selection pressures if they maintain niche construction. Organisms that are less fit. Humans affect our niche construction to make us more biologically fit. Not strong enough to do anything about that lion, I'll invent a gun. Genetic losers are more likely to move environments. Turning your traits into an advantage. Humans are the ultimate niche constructors. </p>
<p>People developed evolution theory independently in isolation. New discoveries happen all the time. Evolution is very complicated. It's not about going somewhere, it's directionless. Homo sapiens was not inevitable and will not be eternal. All species are time limited. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 4: May 8, 2017</p>

<h1>Microevolution</h1>
<p>##Microevolution## is short-term evolutionary change that occured in an ecological time. Generations of living organisms. ##Macroevolution## is long-term that changes in geological time. </p>
<p>Combining ideas of Darwin and Mendel. How Natural Selection works with heredity - ##Neo-Darwinism##. Debunking of the 19th century of race. Wanted to find scientific boundaries of race. Two schools: 1. all people on the planet are the same members of a species, 2. Everyone is members of different species. After WWII, anthropologists rejected the work of physical anthropologists (measuring physical differences of different populations) -> biological anthropology. </p>
<ul>What is a species? 
	<li>Darwin: A species is a distinct segment of an evolution lineage. Boundaries between species are blurrier than you imagine.</li>
	<li>##Biological Species Concept##: A reporoductive community of populations that occurs in a specific niche in nature. Can interbreed to product viable (they can breed) offspring. Hybridization. </li>
	<li>##Phylogenetic Species Concept## (Taxonomists) - On the basis of unique features. </li>
	<li>##Phenetic Species Concept## (Paleoanthropologists) - Take living species and measure the morphological differences between them. The degree of how these two things differ in species. </li>
</ul>
<p>Species are separated into ##populations##. They may separate (reproductively isolated)and reintegrated - ##reticulation##. If a population is separated for long enough, they become a different species. Populations of ##organisms##. </p>
<p>Interbreeding between species do not ruin th eboundaries because the offspring are sterile. <span class="ex">Horses and Donkeys = mules, but mules are infertile.</span></p>
<p>##Gene Pool## - All the genes in all the bodies of all the members of a given species. All the genes of all humans. Population genecists estimate frequency of a gene if something happened. Most alleles are polymorphous (range of different forms) - account for m ost of the variation across populations. They have the same alleles but in different frequencies. <span class="ex">A, B, O, AB exist in all human populations. Different populations are characterizied more by one blood type than the others. </span> #Private polymorphism## - allele occurs in a given population, but not others, but not all members of the population have it. There is greater variation within racial groups than there is between them. <span class="ex">Unlikely bone marrow matches. Perfect genetic bone marrow match - little white boy and black man. Genetically, they are extremely similar. </span> "Race" is a cultural label, not biological. We cluster people by their physical alleles. </p>
<p>Phenotypes shift very gradually from one place to the next. <span class="ex">If you mapped skin colour then mapped hair texture, they don't match up.</span> Cline is a gradual phenotypic mapping in a trait. We don't see it unless people who are very far apart on a trait are brought together. Skin pigmentation is distributed the way it is because of natural selection. <span class="ex">The closer to the equator you are, the more selective advantage it is to have darker/lighter skin.</span> TRaits are operating on different selective pressures. Each cline is only going to map a single trait. Clinal distributions of different traits do not go together -> disproves race theory.</p>
<p>No biological race!</p>
<p>People trying to resurrect the race theory. </p>
<p>Molecularization of race: ##HUman genome project## - identify all the genes in human DNA. Wanted to sequence all the chemical based pairs, store on databases, improve tools for data analysis. Medical professionals use available data from your group to predict stuff. Focusing on classifying people's genotypes. Race has become a thing - a molecular attribute. Which ancestry markers on which parts of the world. People jusut wanna know ancestrial background to make proxy predictions. Race is not biology, but biology is not genetics. People embody the social inequality of their group. <span class="ex">Blood pressure. Puerto rico - darker skin => high blood pressure. The higher the socio-economic status of dark skinned - higher blood pressure. People with darker skin is subject to racist conditions. The higher up the ladder a dark-skinned person goes, the more likely they are to experience intense racism. SKin color + class => higher blood pressure.</span></p>

<h1>4 Evolutionary Processes </h1>
<ul>
	<li>@@Natural Selection@@</li>
	<li>@@Mutation@@</li>
	<li>@@Gene Flow@@ - Gene frequencies can be changed drastically</li>
	<li>@@Genetic Drift@@ - Bottleneck effect and Founder effect. Random changes in gene frequencies from one generation to the next. Doesn't have an effect on large staple positions. Gamechanger in smaller population if you have disease/natural disaster -> population bottleneck. Or if you have a subgroup, breaking off a population -> new population has a different gene frequency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chance plays a large role. Mutation - random. Difficult to predict large-scale natural disasters/migrations and what effect these have. Climate change. Niche construction. Early humans constructed their own niches - control fire, make shelter, clothing. Humans were able to expand their radius - subject to differnt courses of natural selection. Disease and human-made environmental changes. Disease takes advantage of niches we have created. Hunter gatherers - suffered from parasitic infections, or animal diseases. After we domesticated pets, had plants, everything changed. Hunter gatherers - keep moving when trash a place. When you settle down, deal with sanitation. Come into contact with more people. endemic diseases - particular to a population. <span class="ex">Measles. Need a million people. Go through entire population. </span> Build up genetic resistance. HIV was an endemic disease. Ebola may become. Kills off people with no resistance before they can breed. The people wo are left are naturally more resistant. Recurring epidemics had a big impact on genetic landscape. <span class="ex">The plague - parasitic disease. Fleas, rats. The Black Death. 1/3 of population gone. Over hundreds of hundreds of years, it would come through and kill fewer and fewer people because people were developing a resistance to it. Attaches to the same attachments as HIV does. Some European populations have resistance of HIV. Some people where their attachments are inward facing, so virus can't attach.</span> </p>

<p>Population genetecists predict models. Effects of inbreeding/outbreeding in a population. Inbreeding: increases homozygous - 2 copies of the same gene. Increase desirable traits, but could get undesirable traits. Decreases genetic variation over many generations. If environment changes, this can be a challenge. Mating with outgroups is common. ##Incest taboo## - at some level, outbreeding is maintained. What counts as incest varies. <span class="ex">Spanish royal family - died out. Habsburg. </span> </p>

<p>Genetic relationship between populations are best understood with Gene Flow - superficially distinct. Lots of interbreeding in the New World (European, Indigeneous, African). Isolated and brought together. Europeans conquered Indigeneous, ensalved Africans. Indigeneous couldn't resist European diseases and died. </p>
<p>Genetic Drift - bottleneck. <span class="ex">What happened on fitcarrin island. Mutiny on the Bounty. Late 18th century. From Tahiti to West. Weren't mature enough - red fruit. Waited for many months - all men. Began relationships with local women. Most men didn't want to leave. Orchestrated mutiny. Chucked Captain Bly off the ship. Bly returned to England. People went to Tahiti to hang them. Didn't find all of them. Some stayed, others left. Invited partners + friends from Tahiti. Abducted them. Went to Pit Karen island. Location was incorrect on the maps. Population of island was 9 British mutineers, polynesions. Founder effect. Not genetically represented of population, creating a population. </span></p>
<p>Mutation - responsible for creating all the variant alleles. Sometimes beneficial, will spread over time due to natural selection. <span class="ex">Sickle cell anemia. In most human populations, only form of hemoglobin. In some, there is a mutant form - not fat. Can't carry much oxygen. Homozygous version is fatal, would predict it would have died out. People who are heterozygous for this allele are much better at resisting Malaria - more genetically fit. So it has survived in these populations. Niche construction - no place for mosquitoes. domestication of plants lead to land clearing, lead rainwater to collect in stagnant pools. Hosts for malarial parasytes were increasing, more Malaria.  </span></p>

<h1>Adaptation and Human Variation</h1>
<p>Gene expression in a vacuum. Environmental factors can have a big impact. Organisms are always responding to their environment even before they're born. <span class="ex">Allergies. Worse in modern industrialization of western countries. Malaui - no peanut allergies. Children who are born to women who live on a farm almost never develop allergies. Even if they move to the city right after they were born. Doesn't matter if you move to a farm after you're born. </span><span class="ex">Dutch Famine - WWII. Germans occupying area made a blockade and prevented food from getting in. Increase in diabetes, cardiovascular disease among descendants of pregnant women in Dutch Famine. Children of those children were smaller. Long-term consequences. </span> Phenotype is responsive to the environment - ##Phenotypic Plasticity##. </p>
<ul>3 Types of phenotypic adaptations
	<li>Genetic adaptation: sickle cell</li>
	<li>Short-term: Shivering when it's cold. </li>
	<li>Developmental: People who grow up in high altitudes - less oxygen so they grow bigger chests, even people who weren't born there. Develop depending on how long they live there and when they arrived. </li>
</ul>
<p>Skin colour - variations occur because of interactions between a few different genes. Adaptive response to UV radiation. Similar skin colours have evolved independently in different places in similar conditions. Darker towards equator, lighter away. We don't have hair all over our bodies. We lost fur because we needed to sweat more - developed darker skin. In general, women are paler than men. Babies always paler. UV - more Vitamin D. Indigeneous are paler near equator because they don't have thousands of generatons. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 6: May 12, 2017</p>
<p>Intelligence - what is intelligence? We tend to think that people who are intelligent are good in formal schooling and succeed in commerce. The tests created are really good at measuring your verbal abilit yan dmathematical logical ability. IQ (Intelligence quotient) Tests - measures your ability to take an IQ test. There are many different kinds of intelligence. Bodily anesthaetic, inter/intrapersonal intelligence, musical intelligence, spatial intelligence. Environmental support can make you better. All kinds of intelligence can be enhanced. Some things you are naturally better at, but you can improve. If you try to make statements about different populations. Highly unlikely that skin colour covaries with intelligence. IQ tests are measuring your ability to take tests (your willingness and value), cultural knowledge. Performance most accurately predicted by your social class and educational background. If control with these, differences between by races are eliminated. </p>

<h1>Phenotype, Environment, Culture</h1>
<p>Not every single phenotype trait is adaptable. Wings in birds are adaptations, wings in insects are exaptations. It could be a byproduct of some other thing that was shaped by natural selection.  </p>
<p>Phenotypes also shaped by the environment. <span class="ex">Guatamalans are short, small because of the environment. They didn't get enough food. If born in North America, they are large. People can't grow tall without a good enough nutrition.</span> Genes don't hold the answer to everything. We only have twice as many genes as an earthworm, but are much more complex. Sociobology - behavioural ecology, evolutionary psychology, gene-culture co-evolution, cultural group selection, niche construction. Group of evolutionary theorists. Took stuff from ants and applied to humans. Based on mathematical models. Evolutionary psychology was studying selfishness and altruism. Logical deduction about the past is speculative. We reveal our own biases. </p>

<h1>Macroevolution</h1>
<p>microevolution - at the pace of humans. Macro - geological evolution. Tracing extinctions. Genesis of new species. How did this occur? Fossils. Can study living organisms - map their genomes. </p>
<p>Darwin believed that if you have microevolution, new species are going to happen. There's no such thing as a fixed species. Evolution is gradual as environments change gradually and mutation accumulates gradually. ##Anagenesis## - gradual somthing of species over time (phyletic gradualism) The thing that characterisizes a species gradually changes over time. Can't explain why a single species why a single species can give rise to multiple new species. Why extinction occurs.</p>
<p>##Cladogenesis## - punctuated equilibrium - between fossil breaks, species were pretty stable and show little if any change at all. Stable species exist in an equilibrium. But equilibrium is punctuated by new species. Sudden bursts/changes in environment. They think species are pretty stable. Speciation is the catalyst for adaptive changes. You have natural selection on related species of a single genus. You get branches and overlap, there was some rapid climate change and natural selection happened. Some species are better adaptive. Homosapiens were better adaptive than Neanderthals so Homossapiens survived and Nanderthals did not. Some species are more fit than other sfor different envionmental conditions. Things can change very quickly. </p>
<p>Which one is right? There is evidence for both of these theories. </p>

<h1>Primates</h1>
<p>Why study primates? </p>

<h2>How do biologists classify primates</h2>
<p>Taxonomy: system with 7 different lvels. Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. King phillip can only find german species. keeping precious c for grumpy scientists. Latin names. Genus name is generic name that is capatilized. 2nd word is species name. Both always in italics. </p>
<p>Prosimians - least complex, lemurs, Anthropoids - monkeys, apes, humans, more advanced -> subdivided into Hominoids - apes, humans, Hominins - only homo sapiens left.</p>
<p>Even if two species have similar adaptations, doesn't mean they're related. Homology - two species have similar adaptations because they desceneded from common ancestor. Homoplasy -two species have similar adaptations but they are not related - because of similar environments in parallel. </p>
<p>##Cladistics## focuses on Homology. Try to determine what is the degree of similarity/difference to get a new species. Which one are from a common ancestor. Phylogenetic species concept. Any group with its own set of characteristics gets their own species. </p>

<p>Different categories of primates: </p>
<p>1. Prosimians - Strepsirrhines. Non-human primates are mostly found in the tropics. Makes them unlike other mammals. We would be the same if we didn't learn to build shelter. Lemurs and lorises. Exclusive to Madagascar. Lorises in africa, asia. The skin between their upper lip and gums is connected. Thye have a tooth comb for grooming. Retain a claw instead of nails. Uterus of females is different. Placenta is different. They used to exist everywhere, but Madagascar split off. Lemurs were isolated from competition. Other primates in africa outcompeted them. When people showed up in Madagascar, lots of them became extinct. Both live in trees and are nocturnal. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 7: May 15, 2017</p>
<p>Haplorhines - Tariers &amp; Anthropoids. </p>
<p>##Tarsiers##: small, nocturnal, enormous eyes, mainly eat insects, very cute. Bad pets. Commit suicide in captivity - will bash themselves in the head. </p>
<p>##Anthropoids## - the monkeys, apes, humans. </p>
<p>##New World Monkeys (Platyrrhines)## - In the new world. In americas. Platyrrhines mean they have sidways pointing nostrils. More teeth. Some have prehensile tails - can wrap around trees. They all live in trees (arboreal). Only branch of anthropoids we can find in the americas. </p>
<p>##Old World Monkeys (Catarrhines)## - Nostrils point down. Some live on ground. </p>
<p>Among old world monkeys, two different branches - Colobines and Cercopitthecines. Colobines - all arboreal. Have 4-chambered stomachs - eat a lot of leaves. Cercopithecines - some arboreal, some ground-dwelling. Baboons. Single male groups. Flexible behaviour. Macaques. </p>
<p>The Catarrhines are subdivided into old world monkeys and Hominoidea - apes, humans. We have smaller canines, different molars, different jaws. We don't have tails, apes don't have tails. Apes - lesser apes, great apes. Lesser apes - gibbons, etc. Great apes - orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos. Hominids/Hominins. </p>
<p>Some apes are more closely related to others. We're more related to bonobos and chimps (98%). But very close to all of them. 97% with gorillas. 95% with orangutans. Chimps/bonobos in hominids. humans in hominins. We've outcompeted all of them. Gibbons - Hylobatidae - no sexual dymorphism - males and females are the same size - manogomous. Orangutans live in rainforest in Indonesia - endangered - very solitary - hard to study - societies. We know more about Gorillas than ORangutans. Gorillas live in Africa - very endangered. Leakys sent out researchers. Don't have many offspring. Chimpanzees. Bonobos look like chimpanzees - thought they were subspecies of chimps, but they're a different species. Central Africa south of a river. Not as robust, strong. Longer legs. Chimps - Bands of unrelated males. Bonobos - strong female bonds, strong bonds. Sex is very important in Bonobos social behaviour. Sexual behaviour is more about social interaction - how conflicts get settled. Chimps make tools. </p>
<h1>Ethnoprimatology</h1>
<p>Study of interactoins between humans and other primates. Humans are agriculturalists, and primates are raiders of crops. Lots of conflict between the two groups. We use primates as tourist attractions in conversation areas. look at how primates are affected by humans. Great apes require forests and reproduce slowly - they cna't recover very fast. We cut down all the trees - habitat destruction. Sold as pets, as meat. Some primates co-exist really well with humans - baboons, macaques. </p>

<p>Patterns in Primate Evolution</p>
<p>What separatesprimates from other living things? Ancestral characteristics, past evolutionary trends, unique features. Some ancestral characteristics - 5 digits on hands and feet, clavical - for shoulder-joint flexibility, clantagrade locomotion - palms of hand, soles of hand for moving. Evolutionary trends - increasing brain size relative to body size, increasingly complex neo-cortex (complex thought), reduction of prognathism (reduction in snouts, flatter faces, decrease reliance on smell, dry nose), increase dependance on sight - eyes have relocated to the front, overlapping visual field - really good depth pereption - stereocopic vision, not as many teeth, increasing infant dependance - decrease dependance on instinct. Unique features - opposable thumbs, most have nails instead of claws, finger and toes with lots of nerve endings, dermal ridges - fingerprints, toeprints, bottom of prehensile tails. </p>
<p>How didi they come about? Aboreal adaptations, switch to plant eating. </p>
<p>When did it happen? </p>
<p>65 million years ago. Dinosaurs died out on mass. Everything changed. Around when the first primates appeared.  A number of epochs. </p>
<ul>
	<li>@@Paleocene@@ 10 million years. 65-55 million years ago. Primates began to appear. Primates evolved from Plesiadapiform group (squirrel monkeys). </li>
	<li>@@Eocene@@ 50-38 million years ago. Know for sure primates were here. Skeletons. Too main groups - Adapids - looked a lot like contemporary lemurs, more teeth, more lower teeth, no tooth comb, Omomyids - looked a lot like Tarsiers, nocturnal, climbing and clinging, insectivores, fruits, haplahhrines. Parapithecids - betwene Eocene and next epoch, looked a lot like new world monkeys. </li>
	<li>@@Oligocene@@ - 38-23 mil years ago. Global cooling, many environments dried out. Adapids became extinct unless they got to Madagascar away from competition. New group - Propliopithecids - early Anthropoids, bigger than Parapithecids, teeth were like old world monkey teeth, more direct ancestors to monkeys, apes, humans, unable to swing from trees, smaller brains, more of a snout. Earliest hominoids (apes, humans) appeared. </li>
	<li>@@Miocene@@ 23-5 mil years ago. Continents finally reached their current positions. Why the earliest hominoids were only in Africa. Proconsul - about as big as gibbon, ape-like, no tail, also looked like monkey, probably arboreal, fruit eating. Near the end, Baboons, macaques were very successful. A lot of hominoids, apes became extinct. </li>
	<li>@@Plyocene@@ 5mil to 2.5 mil yrs ago. First hominins began to appear. </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<h1>Dating Methods in Archaeology and Paleoanthropology</h1>
<p>How do you get a date? Arachaeology's Dirty Little Secrets. Archaeology Dating LEcture PPart 1 Brown</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>Relative dating - lines thing sup before and after. Stratigraphic exacation - relative position of finds - you cant tell how much older by distance. </li>
	<li>Absolute dating - giving a specific date. fixed points. just how much time. BC and AD. BCE and CE. Before common era. </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<p>Typology- classification of objects of types on the basis of characteristics. Artifact styles change over time. </p>
<p>Seriation - lining things up. CAn reconstruct a sequence. </p>
<p>TAQ - before which a stratum or feature must have been deposited. TPQ after which.. </p>
<p>Dendrochronology - time from trees - a ring a year - rainfall, temperature. </p>
<p>Radiocarbon dating</p>

<p>Law of superposition - how strate are laid down - formation of earth's surface. lower layers are older cause of sedementation. Law of crosscutting relationships - when you get older rock formations that are crosscut - earthquake, things are jossled out of sequence, intruding features are younger. Biostratugraphic dating - relative - distrubution in layers. Seriation - relative dating method based on the asumption that artifacts that look alike must have been made more or less at the same time. </p>
