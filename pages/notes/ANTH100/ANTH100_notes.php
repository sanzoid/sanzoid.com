<h1>What is Anthropology?</h1>

<p>Anthropology is the integrated study of human nature, human society and the human past. The study of humanty in all times and all places. Answer the question: what it means to be human. Taking things that are unfamiliar, and making them familiar. Taking things that are familiar, and making things unfamiliar. Very broad discipline. Social science. </p>

<p>Biology, Philosophy, Sociology, Political Science, History, Psychology, etc. all study human nature. </p>

<ul>The Anthropological Perspective
	<li><span class="list">Holistic</span> - Studies the complex whole. Not just one aspect. </li>
	<li><span class="list">Comparitive</span> - make comparisons of different societies. Not a good idea to make generalizations if you only know about your own society. <span class="ex">Marriage is between 1 man and 1 woman. Look at other cultures. Ghosts may get married. Humans offer a lot of variations. Not the case where only one is natural. </span></li>
	<li><span class="list">Field-based</span> - Data-collection. Go to where the study is. </li>
	<li><span class="list">Evolutionary</span> - Strive to make generalizations that are valid over space and time. How humans have evolved. </li>
</ul>

<p>Demonstrate the separation between biological evolution and cultural evolution. People used to think they were the same thing. <span class="ex">Black people are not as smart as white people. Women not as smart as men. Proven to be not true.</span></p>

<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>A set of learned behaviours that you learn from society. Some learned excplicitly, some learned implicitly. We use culture to adapt to our world and to transform it. The thing that has had the greatest impact on us as organisms and everything else. Very little the human culture doesn't touch. Unique to humans. No other species have anything like it. We're more dependant on learned behaviour. We are born with no instincts to survive. <span class="ex">Giraffe is born, stands up. Human is born, useless.</span> We have a long period of learning before we become adults. So many things to learn that human growth is suppressed. We should be reaching physical maturity around 8 or 9. Childhood is longer among humans because of culture. Humans are <span class="key">bio-cultural</span> organisms - both biology and culture. Biology is what makes us capable of culture. Survival as biological organisms has come to depend on culture. We can no longer survive in the wild. Biology has been affected by culture. </p>

<h2>Biological Anthropology</h2>
<p>Human beings as living organisms. Started in the 19th century in the study of human physical variation. Used to measure physical differences in people - Physical anthropologists - goal was to classify people with races. Ended up proving that race as a scientific category doesn't exist, it's a cultural thing. They are labels invented by people in power.</p>
<p>Now more interested in <span class="key">Primatology</span>, <span class="key">Paleoanthropology</span> - fossilized homanide remains, <span class="key">Human skeletal biology</span> - bones, skeletal remains, <span class="key">Molecular anthropology</span> - cells, DNA from fossilized neanderthal. </p>
<p>What makes humans similar and different from one another and other species.</p>
<h2>Archaeology</h2>
<p>Archaeology - Specializes in the study of past human cultures. Data obtained from material remains and not living. Mmay work closely with historians and other speciailists with the analysis. </p>
<p>Linguistic Anthropology - We are language users. Other species don't have languages, only have communication systems. Study the ways that language correlates with gender, race, ethnicity, class, etc. Linguistic is intertwined with Cultural. </p>

<h2>Cultural Anthropology</h2>
<p>Cultural Anthropology (Social/Ethnology/Socio-cultural) - Study culture - learned behaviours. Closest to sociology. Interested in all members of society. Social organization, gender, religion, marriage, kingship, etc. Distinct by their methods - data is collected in an extended period of field work - <span class="key">participant observation</span> - attempt to live in the culture for a year. Speak to <span class="key">Informants</span> to compile data. <span class="key">Ethnography</span>  - description of a way of life by the people. ##Ethnology</span> - comparison of two or more groups of poeple. </p>

<h1>Interdisciplinary</h1>
<h2>Applied Anthropology</h2>
<p>You can do it from any division or combine them. Subfield where the anthropologist uses insights from any combination of subfields to arrive at a solution to everyday problems. <span class="ex">There were no razors for women. Applied anthropologists helped Gilette create the first women's razor. </span></p>
<h2>Medical Anthropology</h2>
<p>Studying human health. Biological and cultural anthropology. Critical medical anthropology - take local health issues and link to larger social, economic processes. Colonialism - disease just doesn't occur because of pathogens - could be due to inequality, lack of access to healthcare, lack of access to clean water. Politiciszing issues of health and illness.</p>

<h1>Uses of Anthropology</h1>
<p>Cope with cultural differences. Question the rightness of our own ways of doing something - not starting from the assumption that the way we do tings is right. </p>
<p>Diispell bigoted stereotypes. </p>

<h1>Chapter 3 </h1>
<h2>Evolutionary Theory</h2>

<p>Living species can change over time to give rise to new species. Common ancestry of living organisms. Not just a theory. </p>
<ul>Evidence for Evolution: Change over time
	<li>$$Change over time$$ - fossil record. Found fossilized species that didn't modernly exist. Biological variation. They had to explain the past. </li>
	<li>$$Change over space$$ - Darwin. why does variation exist among living organisms. Variation over space. Finches looked very different on the Galapagos Island - species could change and adapt to different habitats. </li>
</ul>
<p>What did people think before Darwin? </p>
<p>First records - Ancient Greek. People thought the world was ageless - it always existed and it is always going to exist. Others thought that the world was created recently and will end very soon. ##Essentialism## (Plato) - everything in the world is a copy of an ideal world. Every imperfect example in our world had an essence of the perfect thing in the ideal world. All things in the world with the same essence belonged to the same "natural kind."</p>
<p>Aristotle - believed all of the natural kinds could be organised on a continuum: simple to complex.</p>
<p>Judeo-Christian - there must be a greater being. There are no gaps. Made it the ##Great Chain of Being##. They made it a hierarchy - only God is perfect. Humans have souls and material bodies - in the middle. There was no other way to talk about it.</p>
<p>Challenged. Georges Cuvier - anatomist - first excavations. Discovered only 4 major categories of living things. He couldn't find anything else like the fossil species he found. Found that some species weren't always there. Periods of extinction and speciations - revolutions (translated to catastrophe) -> ##Catastrophism##. Probably large-scale natural disasters. Idea that a species would disappear was radical - because there was only one creation to Essentialists. If there was no connection between the 4, then what is the chain? </p>
<p>Idea of intelligent design - a benevolent creator created these species. ##Uniformitarians##. New species appear, but they're also God's creations. The world changes, but it's by design. They disagreed that extinctions happen. They didn't think that God would allow extinction. Charles Lyell - Use understanding how erosion works to understand what the earth looked like in the past. Interested in how old the earth is. </p>
<p>Catastrophist - accept that harmony was occassionly badly disrupted. Sometimes extinctions need to happen. Uniformitarian - events were unfolding according to God's laws. </p>
<p>##Transformational Evolution## Lamarck tried to figure out what could account for all of these theories. He was totally wrong. Wanted to believe the world was harmonious, but couldn't explain extinction - how could perfect creatures become extinct? People said it was because of a flood. But water creatures were also fossilized. Some people thought some were hunted by forebearers. Other people thought they moved somewhere else and we never found them yet - but this was becoming unlikely. He thought maybe the fossil animals are the forebearers. There were changes in the environment, they adapted, passed to descendants, they changed. It's a changing world - Transformational Evolution. Each species transforms into another. He proposed two laws: 1. Organs are strengthened by use and weakened by disuse - use it or lose it. 2. Inheritance of acquired characteristics. <span class="ex">Ex: Giraffes. Plant food on the ground was becoming scarce. Food was only in trees. They kept stretching necks.</span> If you dye your hair green, you can't pass that on. This doesn't work. But it paved the way for Darwin. </p>
<p>Natural Selection. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace. Wallace was an amateur naturalist. Theorized that a given species over time could give rise to species. Over how much time? Archbishop Usher - 9am on Oct 23 4004 BC. Lyell disagreed because of erosion studies - hundreds of thousands - wrong but right idea. Actually 4.5 billion years old. Darwin - </p>
