<h1>What is Anthropology?</h1>

<p>Anthropology is the integrated study of human nature, human society and the human past. The study of humanty in all times and all places. Answer the question: what it means to be human. Taking things that are unfamiliar, and making them familiar. Taking things that are familiar, and making things unfamiliar. Very broad discipline. Social science. </p>

<p>Biology, Philosophy, Sociology, Political Science, History, Psychology, etc. all study human nature. </p>

<ul>The Anthropological Perspective
	<li><span class="list">Holistic</span> - Studies the complex whole. Not just one aspect. </li>
	<li><span class="list">Comparitive</span> - make comparisons of different societies. Not a good idea to make generalizations if you only know about your own society. <span class="ex">Marriage is between 1 man and 1 woman. Look at other cultures. Ghosts may get married. Humans offer a lot of variations. Not the case where only one is natural. </span></li>
	<li><span class="list">Field-based</span> - Data-collection. Go to where the study is. </li>
	<li><span class="list">Evolutionary</span> - Strive to make generalizations that are valid over space and time. How humans have evolved. </li>
</ul>

<p>Demonstrate the separation between biological evolution and cultural evolution. People used to think they were the same thing. <span class="ex">Black people are not as smart as white people. Women not as smart as men. Proven to be not true.</span></p>

<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>A set of learned behaviours that you learn from society. Some learned excplicitly, some learned implicitly. We use culture to adapt to our world and to transform it. The thing that has had the greatest impact on us as organisms and everything else. Very little the human culture doesn't touch. Unique to humans. No other species have anything like it. We're more dependant on learned behaviour. We are born with no instincts to survive. <span class="ex">Giraffe is born, stands up. Human is born, useless.</span> We have a long period of learning before we become adults. So many things to learn that human growth is suppressed. We should be reaching physical maturity around 8 or 9. Childhood is longer among humans because of culture. Humans are <span class="key">bio-cultural</span> organisms - both biology and culture. Biology is what makes us capable of culture. Survival as biological organisms has come to depend on culture. We can no longer survive in the wild. Biology has been affected by culture. </p>

<h2>Biological Anthropology</h2>
<p>Human beings as living organisms. Started in the 19th century in the study of human physical variation. Used to measure physical differences in people - Physical anthropologists - goal was to classify people with races. Ended up proving that race as a scientific category doesn't exist, it's a cultural thing. They are labels invented by people in power.</p>
<p>Now more interested in <span class="key">Primatology</span>, <span class="key">Paleoanthropology</span> - fossilized homanide remains, <span class="key">Human skeletal biology</span> - bones, skeletal remains, <span class="key">Molecular anthropology</span> - cells, DNA from fossilized neanderthal. </p>
<p>What makes humans similar and different from one another and other species.</p>
<h2>Archaeology</h2>
<p>Archaeology - Specializes in the study of past human cultures. Data obtained from material remains and not living. Mmay work closely with historians and other speciailists with the analysis. </p>
<p>Linguistic Anthropology - We are language users. Other species don't have languages, only have communication systems. Study the ways that language correlates with gender, race, ethnicity, class, etc. Linguistic is intertwined with Cultural. </p>

<h2>Cultural Anthropology</h2>
<p>Cultural Anthropology (Social/Ethnology/Socio-cultural) - Study culture - learned behaviours. Closest to sociology. Interested in all members of society. Social organization, gender, religion, marriage, kingship, etc. Distinct by their methods - data is collected in an extended period of field work - <span class="key">participant observation</span> - attempt to live in the culture for a year. Speak to <span class="key">Informants</span> to compile data. <span class="key">Ethnography</span>  - description of a way of life by the people. ##Ethnology</span> - comparison of two or more groups of poeple. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 2: May 3, 2017</p>

<h1>Interdisciplinary</h1>
<h2>Applied Anthropology</h2>
<p>You can do it from any division or combine them. Subfield where the anthropologist uses insights from any combination of subfields to arrive at a solution to everyday problems. <span class="ex">There were no razors for women. Applied anthropologists helped Gilette create the first women's razor. </span></p>
<h2>Medical Anthropology</h2>
<p>Studying human health. Biological and cultural anthropology. Critical medical anthropology - take local health issues and link to larger social, economic processes. Colonialism - disease just doesn't occur because of pathogens - could be due to inequality, lack of access to healthcare, lack of access to clean water. Politiciszing issues of health and illness.</p>

<h1>Uses of Anthropology</h1>
<p>Cope with cultural differences. Question the rightness of our own ways of doing something - not starting from the assumption that the way we do tings is right. </p>
<p>Diispell bigoted stereotypes. </p>

<h1>Chapter 3 </h1>
<h2>Evolutionary Theory</h2>

<p>Living species can change over time to give rise to new species. Common ancestry of living organisms. Not just a theory. </p>
<ul>Evidence for Evolution: Change over time
	<li>$$Change over time$$ - fossil record. Found fossilized species that didn't modernly exist. Biological variation. They had to explain the past. </li>
	<li>$$Change over space$$ - Darwin. why does variation exist among living organisms. Variation over space. Finches looked very different on the Galapagos Island - species could change and adapt to different habitats. </li>
</ul>
<p>What did people think before Darwin? </p>
<p>First records - Ancient Greek. People thought the world was ageless - it always existed and it is always going to exist. Others thought that the world was created recently and will end very soon. ##Essentialism## (Plato) - everything in the world is a copy of an ideal world. Every imperfect example in our world had an essence of the perfect thing in the ideal world. All things in the world with the same essence belonged to the same "natural kind."</p>
<p>Aristotle - believed all of the natural kinds could be organised on a continuum: simple to complex.</p>
<p>Judeo-Christian - there must be a greater being. There are no gaps. Made it the ##Great Chain of Being##. They made it a hierarchy - only God is perfect. Humans have souls and material bodies - in the middle. There was no other way to talk about it.</p>
<p>Challenged. Georges Cuvier - anatomist - first excavations. Discovered only 4 major categories of living things. He couldn't find anything else like the fossil species he found. Found that some species weren't always there. Periods of extinction and speciations - revolutions (translated to catastrophe) -> ##Catastrophism##. Probably large-scale natural disasters. Idea that a species would disappear was radical - because there was only one creation to Essentialists. If there was no connection between the 4, then what is the chain? </p>
<p>Idea of intelligent design - a benevolent creator created these species. ##Uniformitarians##. New species appear, but they're also God's creations. The world changes, but it's by design. They disagreed that extinctions happen. They didn't think that God would allow extinction. Charles Lyell - Use understanding how erosion works to understand what the earth looked like in the past. Interested in how old the earth is. </p>
<p>Catastrophist - accept that harmony was occassionly badly disrupted. Sometimes extinctions need to happen. Uniformitarian - events were unfolding according to God's laws. </p>
<p>##Transformational Evolution## Lamarck tried to figure out what could account for all of these theories. He was totally wrong. Wanted to believe the world was harmonious, but couldn't explain extinction - how could perfect creatures become extinct? People said it was because of a flood. But water creatures were also fossilized. Some people thought some were hunted by forebearers. Other people thought they moved somewhere else and we never found them yet - but this was becoming unlikely. He thought maybe the fossil animals are the forebearers. There were changes in the environment, they adapted, passed to descendants, they changed. It's a changing world - Transformational Evolution. Each species transforms into another. He proposed two laws: 1. Organs are strengthened by use and weakened by disuse - use it or lose it. 2. Inheritance of acquired characteristics. <span class="ex">Ex: Giraffes. Plant food on the ground was becoming scarce. Food was only in trees. They kept stretching necks.</span> If you dye your hair green, you can't pass that on. This doesn't work. But it paved the way for Darwin. </p>
<p>Natural Selection. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace. Wallace was an amateur naturalist. Theorized that a given species over time could give rise to species. Over how much time? Archbishop Usher - 9am on Oct 23 4004 BC. Lyell disagreed because of erosion studies - hundreds of thousands - wrong but right idea. Actually 4.5 billion years old. Darwin - </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 3: May 5, 2017</p>

<p>##Natural Selection## - best explanation that we have to account for biological variation. Every generation naturally has variation. The variants that are better adapted to the nevironment survive longer. This causes change in a species over time as qualities are preferentially passed on. To this view, ther is no essence to species. There is no "humanness," it's just all variation that is all-changing all the time. Have to think about it at a population-level, not individual-level. Lamarck - individual giraffes. Darwin - all giraffes - some giraffes naturally have longer necks - will survive longer with more offspring. Thomas Malvis had this idea that population increases geometrically but resources only increase arithmetically. Early on, not enough resources. Competition for resources so some variants get them and others don't. Those that don't survive, don't breed. ##Survival of the fittest##. </p>
<ul>Darwin's rules
	<li>No two individuals are identical</li>
	<li>Traits are inherited. Offspring resemble their parents.</li>
	<li>Natural selection</li>
</ul>
<p>Aptation - any kind of feature than an organism has, no matter where they got it from. Adaptation - any useful feature that has been shaped by natural selection. Exaptation - a feature that was originally shaped by natural selection and then it's useful for another thing. <span class="ex">Wings on insects were not originally shaped for flying. They were for cooling down. When they became big enough, they became useful for fluttering then flying. </span> </p>
<p>##Biological fitness## - how many offspring do you have. </p>
<p>Main problem with Darwin's theory: no one could explain how heredity worked. People knew traits were passed on, but they don't know how.</p>

<h3>Heredity</h3>
<p>##Pangenisis## - everybody is made up of particles. The particles from each parent merges and gives to child. If child gets more hair particles from father, then hair will be more like father's. </p>
<p>Gregor Mendel - plant breeding experiments with peas. He noticed that pea plants - red flowers + white flowers =/= pink flowers. 2nd generation- 3:1. There is no blending. There's only one particle and every parent just passes just one. ##Co-dominant## trait - equally expressed trait. The particles were ocurring in pairs. Each individual gets one from each parent - ##Principle of Segregation##. When the embryo is formed, the pairs of particles are independently sorted - they come together at random in the offspring. But no one paid attention to it for 35 years. </p>
<p>New science: ##Genetics##. ##Homozygous## - the same trait from each parent. Blue eyes are recessive. Nothing else to express. Different particles - ##Heterozygous##. ##Genes## - particles. </p>
<p>Often more than two variants to a particular gene. ##Allele## - all the diferent possible variants of a trait. <span class="ex">Eye color: blue, brown, green, etc. </span> All chromosomes came in pairs. </p>
<p>Cells have to different kinds of celll stuff - ##mitosis## - when cells make copies of themselves. ##meiosis## - when dividing, chromosomes obey Mendelian principles. The chromosomes are segregated and independently sorted. A gene has a position in a chromosome. Some traits only appeared if other traits were present - linked traits, passed on together. Part of a chromosome can break off and attach to another - crossing over. </p>
<p>They used to think that genes perfectly mapped to traits. Happens in simple cases. ##Polygenetic## traits - governed by many genes. Continuum. <span class="ex">Skin colour.</span>##Pleiotropy## - just one gene that affects many traits. <span class="ex">Sickle-cell Anemia - Genetic condition. Affects red blood cells. Increases resistance to Malaria and decreases amount of oxygen carried in red blood cells. Two copies - fatal. One copy - good.</span>Genes undergo ##Mutation## - a new allele appears. Explained how variation exists. Inheritance can be unchanging, but mutations are totally random. Evolution is directionless. Mutations don't occur because organisms need them. Sometimes they can be good, neutral, or bad. Sometimes mutations are fatal. Lamarck was wrong - you can't modify yourself and pass it down. </p>
<p>They still didn't understand the structure of chromosomes. DNA - deoxyfodjfsfjsd acid. Chromosomes are made of large molecules of DNA. Double helix. 4 bases. Before mitosis, unzip, complementary line up, reform. Mutations - changes in the structure of DNA. </p>
<h3>Genotype vs Phenotype</h3>
<p>Molecular structue can differ from how it is expressed. ##Genotype## - what's there in the DNA. ##Phenotype## - what's observable in the actual organism. <span class="ex">G: has 1 red and 1 white. P: it's red. </span>Geno can say one thing but Pheno is expressed another way. Phenotype is just what happens. Organisms can affect their own environments - ##Niche construction## <span class="ex">It's too cold. I'm moving.</span> Create different selection pressures if they maintain niche construction. Organisms that are less fit. Humans affect our niche construction to make us more biologically fit. Not strong enough to do anything about that lion, I'll invent a gun. Genetic losers are more likely to move environments. Turning your traits into an advantage. Humans are the ultimate niche constructors. </p>
<p>People developed evolution theory independently in isolation. New discoveries happen all the time. Evolution is very complicated. It's not about going somewhere, it's directionless. Homo sapiens was not inevitable and will not be eternal. All species are time limited. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 4: May 8, 2017</p>

<h1>Microevolution</h1>
<p>##Microevolution## is short-term evolutionary change that occured in an ecological time. Generations of living organisms. ##Macroevolution## is long-term that changes in geological time. </p>
<p>Combining ideas of Darwin and Mendel. How Natural Selection works with heredity - ##Neo-Darwinism##. Debunking of the 19th century of race. Wanted to find scientific boundaries of race. Two schools: 1. all people on the planet are the same members of a species, 2. Everyone is members of different species. After WWII, anthropologists rejected the work of physical anthropologists (measuring physical differences of different populations) -> biological anthropology. </p>
<ul>What is a species? 
	<li>Darwin: A species is a distinct segment of an evolution lineage. Boundaries between species are blurrier than you imagine.</li>
	<li>##Biological Species Concept##: A reporoductive community of populations that occurs in a specific niche in nature. Can interbreed to product viable (they can breed) offspring. Hybridization. </li>
	<li>##Phylogenetic Species Concept## (Taxonomists) - On the basis of unique features. </li>
	<li>##Phenetic Species Concept## (Paleoanthropologists) - Take living species and measure the morphological differences between them. The degree of how these two things differ in species. </li>
</ul>
<p>Species are separated into ##populations##. They may separate (reproductively isolated)and reintegrated - ##reticulation##. If a population is separated for long enough, they become a different species. Populations of ##organisms##. </p>
<p>Interbreeding between species do not ruin th eboundaries because the offspring are sterile. <span class="ex">Horses and Donkeys = mules, but mules are infertile.</span></p>
<p>##Gene Pool## - All the genes in all the bodies of all the members of a given species. All the genes of all humans. Population genecists estimate frequency of a gene if something happened. Most alleles are polymorphous (range of different forms) - account for m ost of the variation across populations. They have the same alleles but in different frequencies. <span class="ex">A, B, O, AB exist in all human populations. Different populations are characterizied more by one blood type than the others. </span> #Private polymorphism## - allele occurs in a given population, but not others, but not all members of the population have it. There is greater variation within racial groups than there is between them. <span class="ex">Unlikely bone marrow matches. Perfect genetic bone marrow match - little white boy and black man. Genetically, they are extremely similar. </span> "Race" is a cultural label, not biological. We cluster people by their physical alleles. </p>
<p>Phenotypes shift very gradually from one place to the next. <span class="ex">If you mapped skin colour then mapped hair texture, they don't match up.</span> Cline is a gradual phenotypic mapping in a trait. We don't see it unless people who are very far apart on a trait are brought together. Skin pigmentation is distributed the way it is because of natural selection. <span class="ex">The closer to the equator you are, the more selective advantage it is to have darker/lighter skin.</span> TRaits are operating on different selective pressures. Each cline is only going to map a single trait. Clinal distributions of different traits do not go together -> disproves race theory.</p>
<p>No biological race!</p>
<p>People trying to resurrect the race theory. </p>
<p>Molecularization of race: ##HUman genome project## - identify all the genes in human DNA. Wanted to sequence all the chemical based pairs, store on databases, improve tools for data analysis. Medical professionals use available data from your group to predict stuff. Focusing on classifying people's genotypes. Race has become a thing - a molecular attribute. Which ancestry markers on which parts of the world. People jusut wanna know ancestrial background to make proxy predictions. Race is not biology, but biology is not genetics. People embody the social inequality of their group. <span class="ex">Blood pressure. Puerto rico - darker skin => high blood pressure. The higher the socio-economic status of dark skinned - higher blood pressure. People with darker skin is subject to racist conditions. The higher up the ladder a dark-skinned person goes, the more likely they are to experience intense racism. SKin color + class => higher blood pressure.</span></p>

<h1>4 Evolutionary Processes </h1>
<ul>
	<li>@@Natural Selection@@</li>
	<li>@@Mutation@@</li>
	<li>@@Gene Flow@@ - Gene frequencies can be changed drastically</li>
	<li>@@Genetic Drift@@ - Bottleneck effect and Founder effect. Random changes in gene frequencies from one generation to the next. Doesn't have an effect on large staple positions. Gamechanger in smaller population if you have disease/natural disaster -> population bottleneck. Or if you have a subgroup, breaking off a population -> new population has a different gene frequency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chance plays a large role. Mutation - random. Difficult to predict large-scale natural disasters/migrations and what effect these have. Climate change. Niche construction. Early humans constructed their own niches - control fire, make shelter, clothing. Humans were able to expand their radius - subject to differnt courses of natural selection. Disease and human-made environmental changes. Disease takes advantage of niches we have created. Hunter gatherers - suffered from parasitic infections, or animal diseases. After we domesticated pets, had plants, everything changed. Hunter gatherers - keep moving when trash a place. When you settle down, deal with sanitation. Come into contact with more people. endemic diseases - particular to a population. <span class="ex">Measles. Need a million people. Go through entire population. </span> Build up genetic resistance. HIV was an endemic disease. Ebola may become. Kills off people with no resistance before they can breed. The people wo are left are naturally more resistant. Recurring epidemics had a big impact on genetic landscape. <span class="ex">The plague - parasitic disease. Fleas, rats. The Black Death. 1/3 of population gone. Over hundreds of hundreds of years, it would come through and kill fewer and fewer people because people were developing a resistance to it. Attaches to the same attachments as HIV does. Some European populations have resistance of HIV. Some people where their attachments are inward facing, so virus can't attach.</span> </p>

<p>Population genetecists predict models. Effects of inbreeding/outbreeding in a population. Inbreeding: increases homozygous - 2 copies of the same gene. Increase desirable traits, but could get undesirable traits. Decreases genetic variation over many generations. If environment changes, this can be a challenge. Mating with outgroups is common. ##Incest taboo## - at some level, outbreeding is maintained. What counts as incest varies. <span class="ex">Spanish royal family - died out. Habsburg. </span> </p>

<p>Genetic relationship between populations are best understood with Gene Flow - superficially distinct. Lots of interbreeding in the New World (European, Indigeneous, African). Isolated and brought together. Europeans conquered Indigeneous, ensalved Africans. Indigeneous couldn't resist European diseases and died. </p>
<p>Genetic Drift - bottleneck. <span class="ex">What happened on fitcarrin island. Mutiny on the Bounty. Late 18th century. From Tahiti to West. Weren't mature enough - red fruit. Waited for many months - all men. Began relationships with local women. Most men didn't want to leave. Orchestrated mutiny. Chucked Captain Bly off the ship. Bly returned to England. People went to Tahiti to hang them. Didn't find all of them. Some stayed, others left. Invited partners + friends from Tahiti. Abducted them. Went to Pit Karen island. Location was incorrect on the maps. Population of island was 9 British mutineers, polynesions. Founder effect. Not genetically represented of population, creating a population. </span></p>
<p>Mutation - responsible for creating all the variant alleles. Sometimes beneficial, will spread over time due to natural selection. <span class="ex">Sickle cell anemia. In most human populations, only form of hemoglobin. In some, there is a mutant form - not fat. Can't carry much oxygen. Homozygous version is fatal, would predict it would have died out. People who are heterozygous for this allele are much better at resisting Malaria - more genetically fit. So it has survived in these populations. Niche construction - no place for mosquitoes. domestication of plants lead to land clearing, lead rainwater to collect in stagnant pools. Hosts for malarial parasytes were increasing, more Malaria.  </span></p>

<h1>Adaptation and Human Variation</h1>
<p>Gene expression in a vacuum. Environmental factors can have a big impact. Organisms are always responding to their environment even before they're born. <span class="ex">Allergies. Worse in modern industrialization of western countries. Malaui - no peanut allergies. Children who are born to women who live on a farm almost never develop allergies. Even if they move to the city right after they were born. Doesn't matter if you move to a farm after you're born. </span><span class="ex">Dutch Famine - WWII. Germans occupying area made a blockade and prevented food from getting in. Increase in diabetes, cardiovascular disease among descendants of pregnant women in Dutch Famine. Children of those children were smaller. Long-term consequences. </span> Phenotype is responsive to the environment - ##Phenotypic Plasticity##. </p>
<ul>3 Types of phenotypic adaptations
	<li>Genetic adaptation: sickle cell</li>
	<li>Short-term: Shivering when it's cold. </li>
	<li>Developmental: People who grow up in high altitudes - less oxygen so they grow bigger chests, even people who weren't born there. Develop depending on how long they live there and when they arrived. </li>
</ul>
<p>Skin colour - variations occur because of interactions between a few different genes. Adaptive response to UV radiation. Similar skin colours have evolved independently in different places in similar conditions. Darker towards equator, lighter away. We don't have hair all over our bodies. We lost fur because we needed to sweat more - developed darker skin. In general, women are paler than men. Babies always paler. UV - more Vitamin D. Indigeneous are paler near equator because they don't have thousands of generatons. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 6: May 12, 2017</p>
<p>Intelligence - what is intelligence? We tend to think that people who are intelligent are good in formal schooling and succeed in commerce. The tests created are really good at measuring your verbal abilit yan dmathematical logical ability. IQ (Intelligence quotient) Tests - measures your ability to take an IQ test. There are many different kinds of intelligence. Bodily anesthaetic, inter/intrapersonal intelligence, musical intelligence, spatial intelligence. Environmental support can make you better. All kinds of intelligence can be enhanced. Some things you are naturally better at, but you can improve. If you try to make statements about different populations. Highly unlikely that skin colour covaries with intelligence. IQ tests are measuring your ability to take tests (your willingness and value), cultural knowledge. Performance most accurately predicted by your social class and educational background. If control with these, differences between by races are eliminated. </p>

<h1>Phenotype, Environment, Culture</h1>
<p>Not every single phenotype trait is adaptable. Wings in birds are adaptations, wings in insects are exaptations. It could be a byproduct of some other thing that was shaped by natural selection.  </p>
<p>Phenotypes also shaped by the environment. <span class="ex">Guatamalans are short, small because of the environment. They didn't get enough food. If born in North America, they are large. People can't grow tall without a good enough nutrition.</span> Genes don't hold the answer to everything. We only have twice as many genes as an earthworm, but are much more complex. Sociobology - behavioural ecology, evolutionary psychology, gene-culture co-evolution, cultural group selection, niche construction. Group of evolutionary theorists. Took stuff from ants and applied to humans. Based on mathematical models. Evolutionary psychology was studying selfishness and altruism. Logical deduction about the past is speculative. We reveal our own biases. </p>

<h1>Macroevolution</h1>
<p>microevolution - at the pace of humans. Macro - geological evolution. Tracing extinctions. Genesis of new species. How did this occur? Fossils. Can study living organisms - map their genomes. </p>
<p>Darwin believed that if you have microevolution, new species are going to happen. There's no such thing as a fixed species. Evolution is gradual as environments change gradually and mutation accumulates gradually. ##Anagenesis## - gradual somthing of species over time (phyletic gradualism) The thing that characterisizes a species gradually changes over time. Can't explain why a single species why a single species can give rise to multiple new species. Why extinction occurs.</p>
<p>##Cladogenesis## - punctuated equilibrium - between fossil breaks, species were pretty stable and show little if any change at all. Stable species exist in an equilibrium. But equilibrium is punctuated by new species. Sudden bursts/changes in environment. They think species are pretty stable. Speciation is the catalyst for adaptive changes. You have natural selection on related species of a single genus. You get branches and overlap, there was some rapid climate change and natural selection happened. Some species are better adaptive. Homosapiens were better adaptive than Neanderthals so Homossapiens survived and Nanderthals did not. Some species are more fit than other sfor different envionmental conditions. Things can change very quickly. </p>
<p>Which one is right? There is evidence for both of these theories. </p>

<h1>Primates</h1>
<p>Why study primates? </p>

<h2>How do biologists classify primates</h2>
<p>Taxonomy: system with 7 different lvels. Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. King phillip can only find german species. keeping precious c for grumpy scientists. Latin names. Genus name is generic name that is capatilized. 2nd word is species name. Both always in italics. </p>
<p>Prosimians - least complex, lemurs, Anthropoids - monkeys, apes, humans, more advanced -> subdivided into Hominoids - apes, humans, Hominins - only homo sapiens left.</p>
<p>Even if two species have similar adaptations, doesn't mean they're related. Homology - two species have similar adaptations because they desceneded from common ancestor. Homoplasy -two species have similar adaptations but they are not related - because of similar environments in parallel. </p>
<p>##Cladistics## focuses on Homology. Try to determine what is the degree of similarity/difference to get a new species. Which one are from a common ancestor. Phylogenetic species concept. Any group with its own set of characteristics gets their own species. </p>

<p>Different categories of primates: </p>
<p>1. Prosimians - Strepsirrhines. Non-human primates are mostly found in the tropics. Makes them unlike other mammals. We would be the same if we didn't learn to build shelter. Lemurs and lorises. Exclusive to Madagascar. Lorises in africa, asia. The skin between their upper lip and gums is connected. Thye have a tooth comb for grooming. Retain a claw instead of nails. Uterus of females is different. Placenta is different. They used to exist everywhere, but Madagascar split off. Lemurs were isolated from competition. Other primates in africa outcompeted them. When people showed up in Madagascar, lots of them became extinct. Both live in trees and are nocturnal. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 7: May 15, 2017</p>
<p>Haplorhines - Tariers &amp; Anthropoids. </p>
<p>##Tarsiers##: small, nocturnal, enormous eyes, mainly eat insects, very cute. Bad pets. Commit suicide in captivity - will bash themselves in the head. </p>
<p>##Anthropoids## - the monkeys, apes, humans. </p>
<p>##New World Monkeys (Platyrrhines)## - In the new world. In americas. Platyrrhines mean they have sidways pointing nostrils. More teeth. Some have prehensile tails - can wrap around trees. They all live in trees (arboreal). Only branch of anthropoids we can find in the americas. </p>
<p>##Old World Monkeys (Catarrhines)## - Nostrils point down. Some live on ground. </p>
<p>Among old world monkeys, two different branches - Colobines and Cercopitthecines. Colobines - all arboreal. Have 4-chambered stomachs - eat a lot of leaves. Cercopithecines - some arboreal, some ground-dwelling. Baboons. Single male groups. Flexible behaviour. Macaques. </p>
<p>The Catarrhines are subdivided into old world monkeys and Hominoidea - apes, humans. We have smaller canines, different molars, different jaws. We don't have tails, apes don't have tails. Apes - lesser apes, great apes. Lesser apes - gibbons, etc. Great apes - orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos. Hominids/Hominins. </p>
<p>Some apes are more closely related to others. We're more related to bonobos and chimps (98%). But very close to all of them. 97% with gorillas. 95% with orangutans. Chimps/bonobos in hominids. humans in hominins. We've outcompeted all of them. Gibbons - Hylobatidae - no sexual dymorphism - males and females are the same size - manogomous. Orangutans live in rainforest in Indonesia - endangered - very solitary - hard to study - societies. We know more about Gorillas than ORangutans. Gorillas live in Africa - very endangered. Leakys sent out researchers. Don't have many offspring. Chimpanzees. Bonobos look like chimpanzees - thought they were subspecies of chimps, but they're a different species. Central Africa south of a river. Not as robust, strong. Longer legs. Chimps - Bands of unrelated males. Bonobos - strong female bonds, strong bonds. Sex is very important in Bonobos social behaviour. Sexual behaviour is more about social interaction - how conflicts get settled. Chimps make tools. </p>
<h1>Ethnoprimatology</h1>
<p>Study of interactoins between humans and other primates. Humans are agriculturalists, and primates are raiders of crops. Lots of conflict between the two groups. We use primates as tourist attractions in conversation areas. look at how primates are affected by humans. Great apes require forests and reproduce slowly - they cna't recover very fast. We cut down all the trees - habitat destruction. Sold as pets, as meat. Some primates co-exist really well with humans - baboons, macaques. </p>

<p>Patterns in Primate Evolution</p>
<p>What separatesprimates from other living things? Ancestral characteristics, past evolutionary trends, unique features. Some ancestral characteristics - 5 digits on hands and feet, clavical - for shoulder-joint flexibility, clantagrade locomotion - palms of hand, soles of hand for moving. Evolutionary trends - increasing brain size relative to body size, increasingly complex neo-cortex (complex thought), reduction of prognathism (reduction in snouts, flatter faces, decrease reliance on smell, dry nose), increase dependance on sight - eyes have relocated to the front, overlapping visual field - really good depth pereption - stereocopic vision, not as many teeth, increasing infant dependance - decrease dependance on instinct. Unique features - opposable thumbs, most have nails instead of claws, finger and toes with lots of nerve endings, dermal ridges - fingerprints, toeprints, bottom of prehensile tails. </p>
<p>How didi they come about? Aboreal adaptations, switch to plant eating. </p>
<p>When did it happen? </p>
<p>65 million years ago. Dinosaurs died out on mass. Everything changed. Around when the first primates appeared.  A number of epochs. </p>
<ul>
	<li>@@Paleocene@@ 10 million years. 65-55 million years ago. Primates began to appear. Primates evolved from Plesiadapiform group (squirrel monkeys). </li>
	<li>@@Eocene@@ 50-38 million years ago. Know for sure primates were here. Skeletons. Too main groups - Adapids - looked a lot like contemporary lemurs, more teeth, more lower teeth, no tooth comb, Omomyids - looked a lot like Tarsiers, nocturnal, climbing and clinging, insectivores, fruits, haplahhrines. Parapithecids - betwene Eocene and next epoch, looked a lot like new world monkeys. </li>
	<li>@@Oligocene@@ - 38-23 mil years ago. Global cooling, many environments dried out. Adapids became extinct unless they got to Madagascar away from competition. New group - Propliopithecids - early Anthropoids, bigger than Parapithecids, teeth were like old world monkey teeth, more direct ancestors to monkeys, apes, humans, unable to swing from trees, smaller brains, more of a snout. Earliest hominoids (apes, humans) appeared. </li>
	<li>@@Miocene@@ 23-5 mil years ago. Continents finally reached their current positions. Why the earliest hominoids were only in Africa. Proconsul - about as big as gibbon, ape-like, no tail, also looked like monkey, probably arboreal, fruit eating. Near the end, Baboons, macaques were very successful. A lot of hominoids, apes became extinct. </li>
	<li>@@Plyocene@@ 5mil to 2.5 mil yrs ago. First hominins began to appear. </li>

<h1>Dating Methods in Archaeology and Paleoanthropology</h1>
<p>How do you get a date? Arachaeology's Dirty Little Secrets. Archaeology Dating LEcture PPart 1 Brown</p>
<p></p>
<ul>Two types of dating: 
	<li>Relative dating - lines thing sup before and after. Stratigraphic exacation - relative position of finds - you cant tell how much older by distance. </li>
	<li>Absolute dating - giving a specific date. fixed points. just how much time. BC and AD. BCE and CE. Before common era. </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<p>Typology- classification of objects of types on the basis of characteristics. Artifact styles change over time. </p>
<p>Seriation - process of lining things up. Relative dating method. Arranging things in a presumed chronoligical sequence based on cultural stylistic change.  Can reconstruct a relative sequence. Develop a sense of progression. Can say roughly where it lies on a chronological sequence. Where in the development of cars does this lie? Doesn't always work because styles come back - retro. </p>
<p>Want absolute date. Could be on the artifact - coins, time capsules. Coins give the date of the stratum of where it was found. Terminus ante quem (TAQ) - the date before which a straum artifact must have been deposited. Terminus post quem (TPQ) - the date after which a stratum/artifact must have been deposited. You find a floor - lying on the floor at 43 BCE. The floor dates before 43BCE, gives TAQ. If coin was below the floor, gives TPQ - coin came before the floor.  </p>
<p>How else could you get dates? </p>
<p>3 methods of absolute dating: </p>
<ul>
	<li>##Dendochronology## - Time from trees. Sensitive trees grow a ring every year - can see environment. Wider rings, better growth. Find patterns. Can say how old these trees are. </li>
	<li>##Radiocrabon dating## measures the decay of the radioactive isotope of carbon (C14) in organic material - measures decay from the time that it dies to the present. Only things that die. Get a range +- factor. Expensive. Shroud of Turin - linen cloth - death of Jesus - Creation date of 1200 years after death of Christ. Sampling - what part you're going to test. </li>
	<li>##Thermolouminescence## - essence can provide a date by measuring the amount of light energy stored in certain types of mineral crystals in the clay or in the dirt. Certain common minerals store energy from the sun at a known quantifiable rate. If you heat those crystals, that energy escapes and the clock goes back to 0. Compare how much thermoluminsecense of a pot is there to how much should be there. Not very precise. Quick to identify ceramic fakes. Tang horses</li>
</ul>
<p>Dendrochronology - time from trees - a ring a year - rainfall, temperature. </p>
<p>Radiocarbon dating</p>

<p>Law of superposition - how strate are laid down - formation of earth's surface. lower layers are older cause of sedementation. Law of crosscutting relationships - when you get older rock formations that are crosscut - earthquake, things are jossled out of sequence, intruding features are younger. Biostratugraphic dating - relative - distrubution in layers. Seriation - relative dating method based on the asumption that artifacts that look alike must have been made more or less at the same time. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 10: May 24, 2017</p>

<p>Obsidian Hydration. Obsidian - volcanic glass. Humans have used it as a tool. If you fracture it, it absorbs water at a known rate. Hydration layer gets thicker and you can measure it. If you can tell it was fractured by human activity, it's useful. Lots of different kinds of obsidian - only some rates are known. Rate of obsidion hydration. Date back to 7.2 million years ago. Cheap method of getting a date. If used as a tool, measure it. Lots of people waiting on funding to get a date on stuff. </p>

<p>##Numerical Dating(Absolute Dating): ##Isotopic methods: scientific knowledge of rate of decay of radioactive isotypes. We know the rate of decay. Potassium-argon dating - radioactive potassium 40 will decay into argon 40 at a known rate. If you wanna find out how old a volcanic rock is, easy. Volcanic eruption - all of the argon 40 escapes. As lava cools, potassium degrades into argon. Amount of argon 40 must have shown up there after lava started to cool. Can date argon 40 based on half life, accurate up to a certain point. Standard deviation of +/- 10. Bad thing: volcanic rock isn't conveniently located next to/ on top of your fossils. </p>
<ul>
	<li></li>
	<li>##Fission-track dating - things being heated up, clock set to 0. Uranium 238 in natural glasses and manufactured glasses. When Uranium 238 fissions, it leaves tracks. Count up tracks. When glass was created (by heat), atomic clock is set to 0. Tracks there appeared after glass was created. Have to know two different kinds of Uranium - 235, 238. Date things back to 2.5 billion years ago. Accurate to about 300k years ago. </li>
	<li>##Uranium series dating## - based on decay of uranium 238,235, forium 232. Travel through unstable isotopes until lead.|| As it decays, all unstable isotopes solidify and settle to the bottom. Date the soil of ancient sea beds. (radio carbon)?</li>
	<li>Radio Carbon</li>
	<li>Thermoluminescence </li>
	<li>Electron spin resistance - Date tooth enamel. After we die, our tooth enamel absorbs uranium at a known rate. Good for cross-checking thermoluminescense. Don't rely on having bones or charcoal. Covers time of radio carbn and potassium time range. Not as reliable. Site-specific interference. </li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

 
<ul>Nonisotopic Methods. 
	<li>#Amino acid racemization## - left handed forms and right handed forms. Living organisms only have left handed forms of amino acids. After dead, converted to right-handed versions. Rate of conversion is different for different amino acids. If you know ratio from left to right, you can date. Good for dating fossilized shells. </li>
	<li>##Paleomagnetism## - general way of dating. Earth's magnetic poles were not always and will not always be where they are now. Sometimes they flip. Sometimes quick, sometimes last longs. Polarity shifts are reserved in volcanic rock. All the particles will align to the magnetic pole. Take volcanic rock samples to determine polarity shifts. Use to cross-check other methods. Not precise. Only ballpark.  </li>
	<li>##Molecular Clock## - Get DNA. Look at parts of DNA that are not subject to natural selection. Mitochondrial DNA - has not changed in a super long time. Take m dna of related organisms and compare to see how long ago they must have diverged. Date when we think important events must have occurred. Then look at fossil records. When do we think that chimps and humans diverged? Use DNA to see when. Not everyone agrees, but fossil evidence matches. </li>
</ul>

<p>Model prehistoric climates - figure out what climates would've been when they made their materials. Figure out selection pressures. Deep sea sediments - don't suffer from erosion. Ocean water has to kinds of oxygen - 1 heaver than the other. Glaciation - all of the lighter type gets taken up into the glacier (on top). Warming - lighter type goes back (melts). What kinds of oxygen you're finding. Look at skeletons of microscopic -foriminiferell - also contain oxygen. Scientists know broad climate changes - why do they occur? We know why the current one is occurring, but past ones ?? Corellate to human evolution. Cooling period -> diversification of hominoids. Drier climate -> hominoid extinctions, appearance of first homosapiens. </p>

<h1>What can the fossil record tell us about human origins</h1>
<p>##Hominins## bipedal hominoids (apes, humans). We can walk on two feet for long distances. First began to appear at the end of the Miocene. A lot of grasslands were expanding at the expense of the forest. A lot of hominoids began to die out because selection pressures changed. Primates were arboreal, and then trees begone. Some hominoids began to adapt to these changes by spending more time on the ground. The selection pressures favoured bipedalism in some species. Some species developed the adaptation. We are the only hominins left. There were a lot of species in the past. Us vs. apes. Increasing brainsizetobody ratio, really different teeth. We're the product of ##Mosaic evolution## - all of our traits appeared at different times, different rates.  </p>

<h2>Bipedalism</h2>
<p>All primates have the ability to have upright posture, when they are in trees. Some can walk upright for short distances. Our ancestors, this ability was already present, but it was developed for an arboreal environment. The ability to be upright was exapted to be on ground. Forests gone, move easily on ground. Makes it easier to see predators on the ground. Make you faster at running. Reduces exposure of your skin to the sun (not whole back). Became less hairy because we didn't need the hair anymore. Uses less energy. Access more resources, endurance hunting (go farther, keep going don't have to be fast). Early hominins were omnivores, similar to contemporary chimpanzees. As grasslands grew bigger, spread out. Free hands - chuck spears at things, carry stuff (babies). Babies lose the ability to cling. <span class="ex">Moro reflex (flinch on back) - if babies fell from a tree, it would make them bigger and easier to catch.</span> </p>
<p>Earliest hominins - ##Australopiths##. Oldest remains get their own genus because we don't have enough. Things get regrouped all the time. </p>
<ul>
	<li>##Artipithecus ramidus## - 5.8-4.4mya -One relatively complete skeleton. It could walk upright. Woodland environment. Dispersed trees. From Etheopia.</li>
	<li>##Australopithecus anamensis## - Kenya. between 4.2-3.9mya. Bipedal. </li>
	<li>Australopitecus afarensis - 3.6mya - a trail of footprints walking side by side in volcanic rock. Best known. We have a really good skeleton. Laetoli region near footprints. Tanzania and Etheopia. Stable. 3.9-3mya. First one found in 1974 by Daniel Johnson + Lamane. Bones just there. Erosion happens, stuff just appears. Female skeleton named Lucy. Bipedal locomotion preceded larger brains - Lucy's skull was about the size of a contemporary chimpanzee. Position of forenum magnum (spine goes into skull), in chimps/apes, it goes in an angle because they're not upright. Her pelvis was like ours. Angle of femur - we are knock-knee'd, hips broader and shorter and shallower, because birthing bigger brains, our legs arent straight out of pelvis, need angle from hips all the way to knees. Lucy was knock-knee'd too. Lucy's foot was like ours, not apes. Apes' feet are hand-like. To walk, our big toe has to be in line with the rest of our foot. Contained features still ape-like: longer arms(climb in trees), size of brain, long,curved fingers and toes for gripping branches, </li>
</ul>

<p class="date">Lecture 11: May 26, 2017</p>
<h2>Hominin Dentition</h2>
<p>Teeth of Australopiths - first ventured off from trees, they had to explore new food resources. First changes in diet were visible in A.afarensis. (Pic) Ape, A.Afarensis, Human (homo sapiens sapien. Ape has u-shaped arch, HSS has parabolic arch. Ape canines are bigger, they have bigger spaces - disatyma. To close their job, they need dyastima. Among apes, largest teeth are canines. Our molars are bigger. AAfarensis canies are smaller, dyastima smaller, molers are the biggest, molars are bigger than apes and ours. They needed molars because they were eating vegetable foods for grinding, less ripping/biting (canines). </p>
<ul>Later australopiths - took adaptations to extreme. Fossils in southern africa. 
	<li>Gracile Australopiths - one of them: Australopithecus Africanus - dental features of AAfarensis. Gracile because smaller frame, smaller faces, lightly built. 3-2mya. </li>
	<li>Robust Australopiths - one of them: Paranthropus robustus - huge teeth, massive molars. Rugged jaws, flat faces. Robust in build, heavy set in their limbs. Brain size was not much bigger than chimps, but could control fire and cook meat. Less omnivorous than gracile. Chewing selects for jaw muscles. Plant eating selects for bigger molars. Face broadens and flattens for all of these muscles. Saggital crest - attachment for jaw muscles - point at the top. </li>
	<li>Transitional Australopith - australopithecus sediba.  -</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>The Human Transition</h2>
<p>Man the hunter philosophy - traditional view in paleoanth is that larger brains were selected for because we needed to manufacture all of these stone tools. Matched gender ideals at the time - large, tough, masculine men sticking spears in things, providing for weak, domestic women/children. Research -> there were a lot of plant-eating hominins walking around. They were more scavengers than hunters. Most contemporary hunters/gatherers groups - plant eating is more important. </p>

<h2>Early Homo</h2>
<p>Early homo genus. 2.5-2mya, change in the weather - drying. Mass wave of extinctions. Speciation. Gracile disappeared - evolved into later homospecies but not sure. New hominins - bigger brains from 400-520 to 600. Robustus carried on. Louis leaky first discovered the first one of these - Homo habalus - the handy man - stone tools. Too much variation for them all to be the same homo habulus. Thinner, rounder skulls. Smaller faces, flatter. Start to see parabolic arch in teeth. Bigger brains - result of natural selection. Early co-existed with Robustus. WE don't know if they were ancestors to humans. </p>
<p>Stone tool manufacture - We don't know what tools they were using until they used stones because stones were perserved. More advanced than termite fishing sticks. #Oldowan Stone tool Tradition#. Sharper and pointier. Bashed off flakes. They have wear marks - to distinguish from regular rocks. Animal bones - butchered or not. Cut marks are on top of teeth marks - lions. Lions kill, early homos take dead animal to butcher. </p>

<h2>Homo erectus</h2>
<p>Early homo fossils disappeared 1.8mya. They evolved into homo erectus or became extinct and were replaced by h.erectus. ##Homo erectus## was still coexisting with robust australopiths. Overlapped. H.erectus - migrating out of africa. 12 yo boy - Turcana boy skeleton - would have been over 6 feet tall if he lived into adulthood. Slim. Probably hairless. Could not speak - wasnt as developed. Remains in Repub of Georgia, Java, China, none in Western Europe, but there have been artifacts. Cranial capacity was 1000 cm3. Humans is 1400. Heavy brow ridges. Smaller molers. Different diet - enamel wear. More robust than us. REduced sexual dimorphism like us. Culture - Acheulian Tradition - more sophisticated tools - bisomething hand axe. Lasted for 1mil years. Not a lot of stone tools in Asia - bamboo, but it decays. Clearly using fire. Were they hunting? Find bones with tools. Possibly. They would have been good endurance runners based on their bodies. Australopithecines were good walkers, but not fast. Endurance running is a unique human trait. We can run for longer. We need special adaptations for endurance running - larger butt muscles, tender something, to keep running, you have to sweat a lot. Running generates heat - most animals overheat. Why hunt? Suggestion: they had fire to make meat taste better. Are they our ancestors? They were anatomically modern. Very stable species.</p>

<h2>Homo sapiens</h2>
<p>H.erectus died out. Archaic homosapiens. homo heidelbergensis - probably ancestral to humans. Not stable. What happened? </p>
<ul>Hypothesis
	<li>Out of africa - some subpopulation of H.erectus went through a selection period and became homo sapiens. And then they spread out of africa and replaced homo erectus everywhere. Climate change during Ice Age. Many disagree.</li>
	<li>Regional Continuity hypothesis - evolution of homo sapiens occur gradually in all h.erectus populations. Morphological evidence. Skeletons. Similarities between H.erectus, neaderthals, europeans/asians. </li>
	<li>Mostly out of africa - in the middle of the two. Perhaps migrated out of africa more than once. Most human anatomy has an African origin. not everything may have come from this homo sapiens population that emerged from africa. Possible that outside of africa contributed - interbreeding between other hominins and homo sapiens. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Neadertals</h2>
<p>Spain. 130kya. German - Neader valley where they were first found. More robust. Shorter. Massive skulls. Large brow ridges for men. Not much of a chin. Teeth placed forward - using incisors as clamps to do things. 1500 cm3 cranial capacity - larger than us. Forehead not as high. Same left/right brain asymmetry. For the most part are right-handed. Stronger grip. Heavily-muscled. Ice age. Warmer places looked liek this. Pelvis was longer and thinner. Are they a different specis or are they a sub species? Probably homo sapiens neandertalis. Suggestion we exchanged genes with them</p>

<p class="date">Lecture 12: May 29, 2017</p>
<p>Neandertals were associated with Mousterian Tradition (tools). Associated with all archaic sapiens. Differs from Oldewan and achulian. They're mainly flake tools. ##Levallois technqiue## - start out with a core, strike things off the sides, then strike it in half, fine retouching. Much thinner. More varied. Lots of tool traditions, more culture. Lots of harths - fire, pits - leaves traces of soil, postholes - what's left after you stick a post in the ground - leaves stain in soil even if wood has decayed, buried their dead in fetal position (suggests beginnings of religion) - show signs of injury, disease, healed injury. To survive, they must have been cared for by others. No other artifact evidence - nothing to suggest anything else. </p>

<p>Neandertals - hunting. Spears - thrown, tied and thrown. Driving animals off of cliffs. Neandertal bones butchered - maybe cannibals, maybe predator. Contemporary: removing flesh from bone for burial. </p>

<h2>Homo sapiens sapiens</h2>
<p>We used to be just Homo sapiens. More than one Homo sapiens. We've reached a stable sapiens sapiens. Africa - population of humans. Anatomically human - cranial capacity of 1300+, domed heads (more forehead), round brain cases, flatter faces, chins, less robust (getting less and less robust). Reinforced by niche construction, increasingly dependant on culture. Making more clothes, building more shelters. Less affected by lack of strength. </p>
<p>Earliest evidence: Etheopia. 200k years ago. We've overlapped with the Neandertals for a long time. Different tool traditions. Modern humans were in Africa for a long time before anywhere else. Emerged there and hung out. Neandertals were in Europe and Asia. After a while, humans moved out -> coexistence between neandertals and humans for 45k. Neandertals not ancestral to humans because at the same time as them. </p>
<p>Mitochondrial DNA - not subject to selection pressures. Used for analysis. Analysis suggests that humans emerged ~200kya. Able to extract DNA genome of Neadertals. Mitochondrial DNA only from mother. Other DNA suggests that anyone who is not of African descent, 1-4% of genome contains Neandertal DNA. None of modern DNA shows up in neandertal DNA. Interbreeding probably occurred in Southwest Asia. Mostly out of Africa is probably the most accurate - DNA evidence supports it. </p>
<p>Denisova - uncovered remains, thought Neandertals, 40-30kya, after Neandertals. Genetically distinct from Neandertals, but not modern humans. Possibly Denisovians and Neandertals come from same ancestor.</p>
<p>Homo sapien neandertalis and Homo sapien sapiens. </p>
<p>Could Neandertals talks? Homo erectus couldn't. Hyoid bone - helps us talk, almost never preserved. DNA of Neandertals - FOXP2 gene - linked to language capabilities, suggests that they had the ability to talk. DNA suggests that Spanish Neandertals were pale with red hair. </p>

<p>Culturally - mousterian tools started to disappear. More complicated tools began to appear. Blades, smaller tools. Things were being hafted to wood, bone, antler, ivory - sticking it to a stick (spear with a point). Bows and arrows start to appear - composite - lots of interchangeable parts. Abandoned Mousterian tradition. Artifacts, jewelry, decoration. People suggest a reorganization of the brain. No way of knowing why they abandoned Mousterian</p>

<p>what happened to Neandertals? If they gradually evolved into humans, why the cultural change? Mixed assemblages -gradual replacement or borrowing? Neandertals disappeared ~5k years of coexisting with humans. No suggestion of humans conquesting. Unlikely that Neandertals evolved into humans. There was interbreeding, but not a lot. Maybe the species boundaries - infertile offspring. Sometimes fertile, but probably not. Minimal hybridization. Neandertals were outcompeted. When coexisting, all usd same stone tools for 45k years. Something happened, humans moved out, and better at surviving. </p>

<h1>How do we know about the human past?</h1>
<p>Archaeology proper. </p>
<h2>What is Archaeology?</h2>
<p>Archaeologists mainly interested in the archaeological record - material evidence of human modification of the physical environment. Non-portable stuff. Architecture, irrigation, farming - leave traces. Past-tense of cultural anthropology. Culture of the people who aren't around anymore. No informants. </p>
<p>How do they reconstruct the past? First archaeologists - reconstruct material remains. <span class="ex">Gluing pot together</span><span class="ex">Heinrich schliemann - found Troy. People thought Homer only made a good story. Schliemann believed in happened. He found it. He stole artifacts. Just used dynamite. Blew up Troy. </span> They were not very good at recording stuff. </p>
<p>Became interested in reconstructing the lifeways. Got better at keeping records. 1960s - interested in cultural processes - Processial Archaeology. Let's make it into an objective science, was just rich people digging stuff up and not recording it. Make mappings of artifacts - statistical analysis. Crossover with cultural anthro - Julian Steward - interested in what effect the environment had on the culture. OVerlooked the role of human agency. Very focused on the environment. </p>
<p>Recently: Interpretice archaeology - symbolic and congitive aspects of culture, social hierarchy, ideology. Internal fault lines of society, where were the conflicts, why. Pointed out flaws of predecessors - wasnt just environment. </p>
<p>Most recent: what is its role in the stewardship in archaeological sites. Conserving the archaeology for future generations. Wait for future technology. Can't excavate a site without destroying it. Act of excavation is dustruction. Don't dig the whole thing. Leave some for later generations. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 13: May 31, 2017</p>
<ul>Key Terms:
	<li>##Sites## - precise geographical location where there are remains of human activity. Where archaeologists do their work. They look for ##Artifacts.## - Any object that has been deliberately shaped by or near human activity. <span class="ex">Stone tools</span>. They look at ##Features## - non-portable remains of material culture. <span class="ex">Ruins. Ditch - dug. </span> ##Ecofacts## - details about climate and surroundings. <span class="ex">Plant residues, pollen remains - what kind of plants were there at the time. What were they cultivating? Animal bones. </span>##Matrix## - map where everything was, matrix in whihc the artifact was found. Is it gravel, sand, etc. ##Provenance/provenience## - 3D position of the find in the matrix. What is the relationship to other finds in the trench. Has the site been disturbed? Have to understand of how everything relates to each other. ##Ethnoarchaeology## - what you do when you are clear what the artficaft was for or how it was produced. Look at ethnographic record to see if any societies today have similar things. Can do experimental archaeology <span class="ex">Found stone tool. There's a transition between one kind to another. Was the 2nd one better? Make both of them to see which one is better.</span>Once something is deposited in the archaeological record, there's no reason why it should stay there - ##Preservation##</li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of things don't get left behind. Wood deteriorates. "The Stone Age". Those things last, can find in the ground. Pottery - ceramics survive. ##Preservation## is important. Good preservation in extreme climates. Mountaintops - human refrigerator. If conditions are right, we'll find more than just stones and bones. <span class="ex">The Ice Man - found in a glacier. 5000 years. Analyzed stomach for his last meal. </span><span class="ex">Cooking pots - look at food residue.</span>Sites for good preservation - volcanos, mudslides, bogs. </p>	

<p>Sometimes doesn't involve excavating. Why dig? We have so much to analyze. Surveying for what is a good site. Excavations take a lot of time and money - need grants. It's disruptive. Can't dig without destroying it. Remote sensing technologies - can tell wihat's in the site without digging. </p>
<ul>
	<li>##FIeld Walking## - just walk with your eyes on the ground and keep your eyes peeled. Pottery could be above ground from churning. Just identify pots and stuff. Look for earthworks - bumpy - maybe people lived there. </li>
	<li>##Aerial surveys## - can see outlines of sites that you can't see by just walking on the ground. Can see parch marks - features are buried under ground. Stone walls cause roots to do something.</li>
	<li>##Remote sensing##. can tell wihat's in the site without digging. Satellite not as good. </li>
	<li>##LiDAR## - layers to penetrate forest cover. </li>
	<li>##Metal Detectors## - ancient roman coins. </li>
	<li>##GPR - Ground PEnetrating Radar## - sends radar waves through the ground, bounce back up at different rates depending on whats in the soil - can construct 3D models of buried features. Handy for human remains - want to know if they're there. Can see what's in the ground. </li>
	<li>##GIS## - geographic information systems - database of a map with a face. Plot on map. Take into account environmental features. </li>

</ul>

<h1>Excavation</h1>
<p>Systematic uncovering of archaeological remains through the removal of deposits of soil or whatever else is covering them. Excavation is destruction - once it's out, it's out. Today, archaeologists no longer fully excavate. Dig small bits of it and leave the rest for future generations who will have better methods. ##Multilayered sites## - different levels of occupying. Interested in chang eover space and time (depth). More levels of occupation there are, the more likely the layers will have been disturbed. ##Record Keeping## - have to record with photographs. Wooden building - stains soil. Act of digging the post hole destroys it Have to record where it was. Shoveling off to the side. Have to know all the work. Weather may affect. Have to sort out everything. conserve them. Important to not clean the artifact. Artifacts placed in typologies. People always assumed it was indicitive of culture - sometimes it is, sometimes is not. Earrings - worn by a particular group, but not worn by neighbouring groups. Tells you who the people were. If you find pots and tools, you can't make the same assumption because they're not associated with groups. Want to know why they moved into villages. Artifact distribution can answer questions. It's an interpretation. </p>

<p>##Digital Heritage## - programs and techniques adapted from other uses to archaeology. Website for digital heritage, anyone can come and look at it. You have to maintain it. Have to be made online to everyone to whom it is important. Keep things to a certain standard. Have to preserve analog materials along with the digital materials. A lot of digital collections are much richer than analog ones. Those are bones of my ancestors, take them down. Curation. </p>
<p>##Subsistence strategies## of societies - satisfying basic needs for food, clothing, shelter. Human niche construction. Food collectors - small-scale foragers, complex foragers. Food producers - herders, farmers. Food collectors vs. producers. Different strategies. Different environments. Small-scale - on the side, move a lot. Complex foragers - permanent dwellings. Food collection continued side by side with food production. The first food producers only grew on the side. When times are tough, people go collect food full time. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 14: June 2, 2017</p>
<p>Time Team - 3 days to survey and excavate a location. Wessex Archaeology - official report. Every week had a report. Saxons on the Edge. Angle Saxon sites - difficult to find. Looking for the remains of wooden structures. S15E09. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Pr1mvMpDQ</p>
<p>3 days to find out if it's an Anglo Saxon settlement. The Dark Ages. Knave Hill. Pottery. Stick a trench in. Locate best place for trench - geophys. Look for postholes. Could be saxon or earlier, before romans (iron age). Difficult to find AngloSaxon because no tmuch pottery at the time. Buildings were timber. Not a lot of metalwork. It's like faeries, you've got to believe before you find it. Spacing of potholes. Well-dated pottery in the potholes. Concentration of pottery. Big stain - grubhut - anglosaxon building with a sunken floor. Iron Age pottery - 500 yrs before saxons. Hand dig. Not a grubhut. Subsistence economy - produce with their patch of ground. Tend to go for the same areas - iron age and anglo saxons. Mother's side - mitochondrial - some woman - one of the first people to come to britain after the ice age. Father's side - Celt. Needle. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 15: June 5, 2017</p>
<p>People who herd, people who farm, people who do both. Herding - also called Pestoralism. Different kinds of farming: Extensive - Slash and burn farming - need a lot of land for it - clear area of land, burn area for ash for soil, farm plot of land for period of time, move on to the next plot of land. Usually go in an area, cycle through lands. Lower tech - hoes and digging sticks. Intensive farming - less land but farm intensively, fertilizer (manure), plow agriculture, irrigation, increate productivity of land so you can keep farming it. Mechanised industrial agriculture - tractors, common in Canada. How they use land, what kind of crop yield. Small, big, biggest (in terms of the 3). </p>

<h2>Bands, Tribes, Chiefdoms, States.</h2>
<p>Classifying societies in terms of what political structure they have. Louis Henry Morgan - certain political structures go with certain climate/technological environments. Idea: Unilineal cultural evolution - all societies progress in the same stages in the same ordero - people start out as savages, then barbarian with private property, have technologies and political organisations, then civilized - learn to write, etc. Racist way of thinking about things - Victorian was pinnacle of civilization - measure other societies against it. Didn't have data to back it up - speculative guesswork. Others picked it up. People began to come up with economical/political categories.</p>
<ul>
	<li>##Band## societies - foraging groups. Small groups (less than 50). division of labour divided by age and gender. All members have equal access - egalitarien. </li>
	<li>##Tribe## - bigger than a band. Characeristic of Farmers of herders, maybe foragers. Egalitarian, but there's usually a chief that has more prestige, but not more resources. Kinship. Within tribes - smaller lineages. Sodalities - specialized groupings that are pan-tribal (cut across kinship groups) - could be secret societies, age grade, religious group. </li>
	<li>##Chiefdom## - Significant, permanent inequality. Based on wealth and power. Just a chief and chief's family in a different class. Bigger. More craft specialization - people doing different kinds of work - no full time specialists. Greater hierarchy. Some developed into states. </li>
	<li>##State## - stratified society. Permanent inequalities. Defined territories - border defence. Army - defend border, police - defend inside. Enforce law, collect taxes. States run by the elite - gets to say who gets to use force, when, how much. </li>
</ul>
<p>Groups can go back and forth between different levels. </p>

<h2>Whose past is it?</h2>
<p>Archaeology sites have been important markers to the identity among people who think they are descendants. <span class="ex">Machu Pichu - very remote but 300k go there every year, Pyramids, Acropalypse in Athens, Great Zimbabwe. </span>Meanings that local people ascribe to these sites don't always coincide with latest archaeological results. Latest results are not well received. Sites are big tourist sites. A lot of people with hiking boots - can cause damage to sites. Important to local people to use it to make money. Not all people want tourists in their backyard, or archaeologists. Many people want to uncover their own past and keep the artifacts. A lot of people want museums to return their artifacts. <span class="ex">Elgen marbles - went to Greece and brought back to britain. Greece wants back.</span>Sacred objects on display for years that were never meant to be seen - disrespectful. Disputes - why should paleolithic hand axes from Kenya remain in Kenya? No more Homo erectus - we are all descendants, wouldn't we all benefit in seeing them? Skeletons - what do we do about human remains? Recovered from intentional burials - people who believe themselves as descendants may not want them to be disturbed. Depends on region - most Europeans don't care about digging up remains - happy about excavations. In North America - a lot of materials here are from native americans - first nations people are angry that excavated and analyzed - felt that disturbed sacred grounds - sign of disrespect. Religious and political objections - US has NAGPRA - NAtive American Grave Protection and ... Act. Requires that all federal institutions that receive federal funds have to take inventory of all firstnations remains and artifacts - determine whether there are links between any living groups - relevant group has to be contacted and must offer repatriation. Protects lands. Any archaeologist working on land has to consult with local group. People will strike compromises. Keep 1 tooth of every individual. Lots of conflict, compromise, collaboration. Native groups will work with arch. to make their own museums. <span class="ex">Kennewick Man - discovered in Washington in '96. Not immediately handed over to local First Nations people - assumed it was a white settler. Radiocarbonated to be more than 9k years old. Remains were in control of US army of engineers - just repatriate to local group. Then, 8 anthropologists sued them for permission - too old to be related to any contemporary group. FN says they were there as long as time. 8 years to side with scientists. 4 dif tribes and US department appealed decision - scientists got remains but given 10 days to study, make casts. Now no one gets to study, no one gets to bury. </span>A lot of remains in Australia were collected unethically - grave robbing to sell bones to museums. </p>
<p>Destruction of heritage. Taliban government blew stone sculptures - Buddha. Buddhists were part of Afghan heritage. Taliban destroyed many artifacts in museums. Irreplacable. Land development - always something under that land and you're destroying it. Agriculture - plow damage - churned up - not on purpose. Farming and development can't be stopped but they can be made more sensitive. Looting - ransacking sites for goods that can be sold on the black market - since time imamorial. Scale of destruction today is huge. Looters - context is destroyed. Museums would look the other way for donations - now need certificate. A lot of countries have laws that protect heritage - examine before land development - environmental assessment. Commercial archaeology - Cultural Resource Management (CRM) - ensure that cultural resources threatened by projects are responsibly managed or salvaged - major source of income for most archaeologists today. </p>
<p>Archaeology and Gender - arch research is seen in lens of things important in the day. Contemporary social issues cause archaeologists to rethink their conclusions. </p>
<p>Vast majority of archaeologists were men. By 1980's, more equal discipline. Women's movement at this time. Women's contributions had been written out of the archaeological record - archaeological bias - focus on men's work. Feminist archaeologists reexamined older things. Idea that there were only 2 sex roles - lots of societies had more than 2 genders. 
Assumed only men hunted, only women gathered. Study of stone tools (lithic analysis) - always assumed that stone tools were made by men to do manly things - focused on production of stone cores (axes, spears) - assumption that women weren't making these tools cause they had no use for it - but living groups who still use stone tools - women made more than 50% of the tools because they ahd to do food processing and leatherworking. Women were making core tools as well, and made flake tools. Need to reexamine evidence - shouldnt make the assumption. </p>
<p>##GEnder archaeology## - insights from different fields. Identity - how do people recognize themselves as same/different from others. Can't look at things and assume they have a universal meaning. <span class="ex">Venus figures - highly unlikely women looked like that because not enough food. Couldv'e been fertility figures. </span>Figurines of animals, men, and fertility figures. Sculptures of women were the only ones wearing textiles, but they didnt actually wear textiles. Idea that gender may not have been that significant. Malaui - age was greater marker of social standing than gender. Two Spirits burials - Two spritis individual is someone who performs the work of the opposite gender. Male wears the clothing and does the work of females. They're going to stand out from the graves of other people - assumed male skeletons with baskets (given baskets for recognition) - not the case - baskets were associated with all kinds of dif graves. Two male skeletons with female form of arthtiritis with digging sticks and baskets - maybe two spirits. Also associated with work with undertakers - could be two spirits or post menopausal women. Maybe occupation not gender was significant.</p>

<p>Guest Lecture. Dr Wes Adams. Archaeologist. </p>
<p>The NAtufian Culture. </p>
<p>10k years - short period of time. </p>
<p>Beginning: Geological history of the planet Earth. 6.5b years ago - Cenozoic, etc. Primitive ancestors of human lineage. The Quaternary - Pleistocene - Holocene period - where all the evolution of human history fits. Apes emerged in miocene. We are a recent development. Holocene very important - brief summer of the earth - the entire planet got enough warmth, humidity, rainfall that certain bio systems flourished - how humans evolved into us. Pleisotcene was a rough period. </p>
<p>Human development - emerges in upper paleolithic (last 60k years). Almost all archaeology reflected in stone tools. H. habilis - oldewan. Acheulian. Mousterian - more and more specific purposes - becoming tools. </p>
<p>Timeline of anaotmically modern humans (homo sapiens sapiens). Caves - vast majority of upper paleolithic sites. How humans adapted to environment in which they lived. Holocene - just right for human development. Large massive stone tools to being smaller, adaptable tools. Sites have art - cave paintings. Range of different types of food. Mobiliart - mobile art - carved stones. Creation of human form in art. Human by a human. </p>
<p>Subsistence patterns - hunting scenes in cave paintings. Emergence of thought processes of humans being recorded. </p>
<p>Fertility figurines - full-figured, perhaps pregnant. never with the face of the individual. Idea of a person. Probably related to childbirth. Magical processes. Humans are developing a thought process. Flute. Social processes - like ritual. </p>
<p>Social organization - likely small bands, covered fairly large territories to find enough food. Mobile hunter-gatherers. Hunting takes up vast majority of their time. </p>
<ul>Key themes: Humans are in an old world, early societies. The Middle East.  Sedintary 
	<li>Plant geographic zones of the Levant</li>
	<li>Phases and variations of the Natufian culture</li>
	<li>Climate, and climate changes</li>
	<li>Key aspects of Natufian culture</li>
	<li>Evidence for sedentarization - settling down. </li>
	<li>Natufians as the first farmers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Fertile Crescent - Along river to survive. Plant geographic zones - 4 primary kinds of plant zones. Mediterranean Forest - oak and pistachio, Irano-Turanian steppe - foothills of large mountains - rainfall - grasses (barley, wheat, oat), Saharo-Arabian Desert, Sudanian Desert - rocky. Following grasses into Irano-Turanian. Spread out into slightly less ideal landscapes. </p>
<p>The Epi-paleolithic period (25-15k ya). Flint industries - Kebaran Lithic industries. Microblade technology. Small cores and microlith. Humans adapting to subsistence strategies. Evolving, exploiting environment. Final phase - Natufian - Dorothy Garrod - Shukba Cave - key changes in the chipped stone - micro burin technology - tool used to create another tool. Backed lunates - polish on them - vegetabels -> first farmers. Increased number of ground stone tools - grinding vegetables to powders. Natufian culture. Settled societies. </p>
<p>HUman societies moving into Iranian Turanian. Great evidence of Natufian cultures. </p>
<p>Phases - 3 phases based on chipped stone assemblages.</p>
<p>Climate and climate change - Change was very dramatic. pollen, fauna. Climate change in Natufian period - shifting between dryer/wetter phases. Early were wetter than later - Rainfall decreased. Accustomed to eating grasses, population increases. Dryness -> things dry out, food mroe scarce. Cycle. Humans trying to adapt within changing climate. When rainfall increases, doesn't reach same levels of beginning. </p>
<p>Key aspects of Natufian culture: </p>
<p>Technology - innovative, adapt. Whole range of tools. Processing plant material. Grinding tools. Sickles - precise. Bone tools - using micro burin. Decoration - geometric patterns, faces, animal figurines. Art. Symbolic representations. </p>
<p>HUmans in small bands, climate change, tools to survive within small band-scale societies. </p>
<p>Socila organization - personal adornment - beads. Working as groups and the individual. Decorating themselves to differentiate themselves from group. Clusters of huts. Early architecture. Tightly clustered. Modify landscape. Burials. Personal adornment. </p>
<p>Subsistence - mobile foragers to sedinterized populators w agriculture. Hunting was ez. Lots of plant resourcces too. Foraging and hunting still exist, because settle down -> different patterns of exploitation of resources. </p>
<p>Sedentism - the practice of establishing a permanent, year-round settlement. Humans become sedetarized - stable. Evidence: cereal. Commensals - house mice, rats. </p>
<p>First farmers - first to move humans towards farming. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 17: June 9, 2017</p>
<p>Up to where he finished. Were they first farmers</p>

<p>Most of human prehistory, humans were hunter gatherers for 10s of thousands of years. 10k years ago, 3 major developments </p>
<ul>
	<li>##Sedentism## - groups began remaining in the saem place </li>
	<li>##Domestication## - Began domesticating plants and animals </li>
	<li>##Complex, hierarchical social systems## - Some began to develop social systems that were more hierarchical, socially complex than anything had ever been seen before</li>
</ul>

<p>Domestication - humans were quite dependant on culture. Some paid more attention to some parts of material world than others. Some people slipped into domesticating plants/animals. Once you make them, it's not always possible to go back. Why different groups of people developed these adaptations? Environment. </p>
<p>Humans hunter gatheres until 10k years ago - what happened? Signifant for Natufians - the dryness. End of Pleistocene era (the Ice Age). Ice sheets retreating, sea levels rising, environment changing dramatically. Human response - attempting to interfere with reproduction of other species to make them more suitable for us - domestication. Occurred independently about 7 different times between 10-4kya. Hominin ancestors (homo ss) were relying on niche construction. Less and less they wre adopting morphologically. They were creating niches for themselves. We don't have fur when we live in Canada - we do other things - clothing, shelters, fire. Niche construction has been important. 10kya were about to get much better at it. </p>
<p>Plants - was plant cultivation deliberate or accidentally? Big debate. David something - believe that accidentally - Foraging and dropping seeds - Mutualism - humans and cereal plants mutually dependant on each other. <span class="ex">Ants and acasia trees. Trees feed ants, ants protect trees - modified one another's selective pressures.</span> We probably deliberately selected plants that suited us - easier to harvest, more nourishing, tasted better. Arch. who say deliberate are feminist arch because women were gatherers. Women were probably be the early drivers of domestication and plants. Not just people and plants. Ecology - usually modified in the process of domestication. Cultivating is something different. To cultivate, you have to prepare the fields, plant the seeds, sow the seeds, weed things, store things - new way of thinking about subsistence. Proabbly gradual process, required new tools. </p>
<p>Domesticated species rely on the habitats that we create for them. Agriculture is systematically modified the environment of plants and animals to make them more productive/useful for us. Seems like it was probably deliberate - increase yield of wild plants/animals that they were already exploiting. Decrease risk - We know cereal grains like disturbed environments so let's burn this land and next year there will be more - they are weeds. Lots of animals feed on cereal, maybe humans were creating to attract more deer. </p>
<p>Sedentism - increasingly permanent habitation in one place. Remaining in one place. Foragers much more mobile. Not synonymous with farming. Settled down before cultivating. <span class="ex">First Nations - sendentary society. Rich natural resources of NW Coast - permanent settlements around reliable resources. Salmon. Harvested salmon like crops. Don't have to domesticate them. Just wait. </span>Probably occured when humans began to depend on some resources. Began constructing niches to make them even more reliable. Modifies selction pressures of the ppeople who take it up. Modified on self and plants/animals. As you depend on cereals, you settle down, you domesticate them, support bigger population. New selection pressures - agriculture passes, disease organisms (spread easily). <span class="ex">African farmers - stagnant water - mosquitoes - malaria - sickle cell allele. If people didn't farm there, malaria would not be an issue.</span></p>
<p>Domestication of wheat - What did they have to deal with? Wheat is attached to plant stock with a brittle rachis - want seeds to snap off - will fall out and disperse. Seeds don't ripen all at the same time. Dispersed more widely - some will go farther at dif times - spreads out. Seeds protected by a hard husk. No benefit. We want a rachis that will only break when we want it to. Want all to ripen at the same time. Want more of them - as many as we can get. Domesticated wheat - became larger part of our diet. Made it better for ourselves.  </p>
<p>Domstication of animals - capture and tame animals that have desirable characteristics. Most people not into taming tigers. Remove them from their natural conditions and put them in controlled conditions. Once we domesticate, there are more. They benefit from us, we also benefit them cause we eat them. people tried to domesticate animals they tried to hunt - they are mobile - had to confine them - they become dependant on us. Can protect animals from predators, supply them food or take them to places, control reproduce or not. We construct niche of animals, we affect their selection pressures and ours. If we become dependant on meat or milk, we have to follow or lead the herd. Gotta be with them. Herders have discovered that not everyone likes it when you lead yoru herd onto a farm - pasture on fields. <span class="ex">animals after harvested to leave their dung. Before harvest, would start wars.</span> Diseases come from animals - more highly concentrated groups. More concentrated when domesticated than wild. Epidemic diseases like big populations. Animal epidemics will jump the species barrier - affect humans. <span class="ex">Measles - cattle disease. Tuberculosis - jumped - now bovine and human versions. </span></p>
<p>. How we know an animal domesticated? Outside of its natural range, morphological changes - domesticated sheep have smaller horns, dont need to defend selves, age and sex of bones can be characteristic - if lots of immature males, you only need a few males to reproduct an entire herd - aggressive immature males get eaten. A meat herd looks like a lot of young animals. Adult females - dairy herd. Abrupt population explosion. Dog was the first - man's best friend - 16kya - very easy - just get a puppy wolf and feed it. It loves you and hangs around you. Wolves are predators like us. Probably domesticated to help in a hunt or deter other predators. Other animals were domesticated for food, dogs not food. People experimented with all different kinds of animals that didn't work. <span class="ex">None of africa animals are domesticated - elephants, tame elephants but not domesticated.</span>Lots of species cannot breed in captivity. Too fierce, don't want to tame. Wildebeasts cant be tamed. Water buffalos, zebras, giraffes. Sheep, goats are harmless. Hippos will kill you. Sheep, goats were easy - domesticated separately. Goats first then sheep. Cattle, pigs later. Lots of people had great idea of domesticating cattle. Pigs - Turkey around 8kya. </p>
<ul>Stages of domestication
	<li>Random Hunting - not domestication. People start out. Hunters hunt them, don't attempt to control them. </li>
	<li>Selective Hunting - intervene in gene pool. Hunt certain animals. Only young males etc. </li>
	<li>Herd following - specific groups of people following specific herds around</li>
	<li>Loose herding - movements of herd are controlled. Driving them. Ensureing herd moves at same time. Occurrs at certain times of the year. Culling what you don't want.</li>
	<li>Controlled herding - limiting animal's ability. Closely managing their gene pool. Picking out certain animals you want to breed, killing ones you don't</li>
	<li>Factory farming </li>
</ul>
<p>Not all hunted have been domesticated. Controlled hunting of gazelles - but never domesticated - did change though. Reindeer herders. </p>	

<p>Why? What drove domestication? Lots of hard work. Hunting/gathering is easier. Happened over and over again independently over history. Could've been climate change, population pressure. Probably more than one thing going on. ##Broad spectrum foraging## - ice age drew to close, pleistocene megafauna all died out (wooly mammoth, cave bears, sabretooth tigers, dire wolves) - probably climate change or we killed them (overhunted). Increasing numbers of smaller animals were taking over these same niches. Forests/woodlands expanding. Sea levels rising. Population growth. Eat food that was not very desirable to them like wild grains. Difficult to harvest, but easy to domesticate. Good explanation for new world. Other drivers - social driver - small groups had competitive feasting - warfare - people wanting to produce own food to flatten neighbours - hard to find evidence. Regional approach - processes may not have been the same in diff areas - multiple strand theories - what was going on with climate, population, state of technology, social organization, diet. </p>

<p class="date">Lecture 18: June 12, 2017</p>
<p>Natufians - first farmers? </p>
<p>Domestication of plants/animals eslewhere(not natufians)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mexico - in Heimlins. All of a sudden. No slow transition to sedentism. Broad spectrum foraging was the driver. Creating evermore complex niches. Different crops - maise (corn), squash (5-4kya). Beans appeared 2kya. 3 sisters - maise, squash, beans - all planted together - intercropping. Beans fix nitrogen in soil, make soil richer. Maise takes nitrogen out of the ground. </li>
	<li>South America - maise didn't come there until 1k years later. Other crops - root crops - manioc (casava - tapioca) - not prepared properly - poisonous. Potatoes, beans, quinoa (which is now a real hipster crop) - high in protein, dietary staple. Animal - dogs. Animal domestication was less important in the new world. Luck - didn't have a lot of animals that were really domesticable. Only llamas and alpacas. Guinea pigs. </li>
	<li>North America - indigeneous people - most domesticated plants are not used today - goosefoot, march elder, sunflower, squash. Maise was better, forget about first two. </li>
	<li>Africa - coffee. Millet, sortum, teph, okra, </li>
	<li>Asia - jackpot. Rice, yams (not sweet potatoes), sugarcane, garlic, onions, apples, carrots. </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Complex foragers with lots of stuff. Not one driver that applies to all. Natufians - younger dryas spurred domestication, but did not apply to other places. Younger dryas happened elsewhere, but did not drive domestication there. Population pressure - factor in natufians but not americas. Climate change seems to be a precondition to do domestication, but just because you have that doesnt mean you're gonna go ahead and domesticate. </p>
<ul>Consequences
	<li>Agriculture - transformed. Changes concept of land. Free resource to ##property## - something that is owned. Idea that land can be owned - strange to foragers. Cultural behaviours linked to particular places. Graves, grave goods, permanent housing, grain processing, fields and field boundaries, herd remains. Before, they didn't leave a mark on environment. Changed landscape dramatically. </li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Population - explosion. Sedentary -> fertility goes up. Nomadic peoples tend to breastfeed on demand for 3-4 years - suppresses ovulation - not having babies. In our society, nourished so can ovulate. But they didn't have that much fat - low carbs - low fertility. Women had to do a lot of hard work - carry kids while moving - suppresses ovulation. Once settled down, remove factors. Farming is very hard work. Increase in carbs - increase in fertility. Moving around - want to space kids apart - also don't have lots of food for kids - steak, nuts. People got better nourished, girls menstruated sooner. </li>
	<li>Drawback: diet. Paleo diet: more nutritious. Height for both men/women declined by 5 inches once settled down. Most of grains don't have nutritious value - rely too heavily, not getting as many nutrients. People begin to depend on plants - diet becomes less varied. Wheat, maise, rice feed most of the world's people. Contemporary hunter/gatherers use ~100 plants regularly - make use of all plants. Increases likelihood of famine - pests, natural disasters, floods, droughts - could starve if stuff happens to crop. Lose flexibility.</li>
	<li>Environment - downside. More crops, more deforestation -> soil loss. Silted streams. Loss of native species - replaced by domesticated ones. Total destruction of the land - Tegris and ufrades - fertile crescent used to be more fertile - first farmers destroyed the land - they irrigated it with saline water - now just desert.</li>
	<li>Disease - Buponic plague. Malaria - used to be big problem everywhere. Colora. Dispose of animals far from water. Store grain - mice, rats, bugs. Mice/rats bring disease - Black Death - live on our trash. Epidemic become andemic (fixed in population) - genetic resistance, but people become less resistant because diets become less nutritous. </li>
	<li>Labour - farming is harder than hunting/gathering. Desert in drought year - avg bushman spent ~2hrs finding food - no other job - only 2 hrs working - sweet. Farming - hard work - never ends. Division of LAbour - one person can no longer do everything (huntergatherer everyone can do everything). More hierarchy -> social inequality. </li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Social complexity - pretty egalitarian. People retained foraging habits - cultiavted on side. Over time, things changed - southwest asia in fertile creescent, egypt, indis valley, china, mesoamerica, andies. More complex societies. All independently invented social stratification - organized societies differently. People had a place in society - how much power, wealth, prestige. Only way you can do this if you start to produce a surplus. Can't if you just produce just what you need. Surplus -> people can store surplus and gain control. Those people can stop producing. Frees up people for craft specialization - don't have to produce because they can make pots. New classes of people - rulers, specialists, everyone else. Complex - society with large population, has an extension division of labour, occupational specialization. </p>

<p>Archaeological evidence of social complexity - . </p>
<ul>
	<li>monumental architecture - Palaces, tombs, big irrigation works (equidox). Raised platforms, temples, pyramids. Why pyramids? Nobody figure out how to build an arch. Simpler level of technology. Only so much you can do if you want to build something big and you dont have architecture knowledge. Have to build square, rectangle, triangle. Tombs. Difference burial styles. Palaces - people living differently. The bigger the tomb, the bigger the grave goods. </li>
	<li>Grave goods - buried with masterpieces. Power of individual. </li>
	<li>Distribution of artifacts - Lots of kiln, people were firing their own pots. If pile of kilns in one area, industrialization of pottery - craft specialization. excess is hoarded and no one gets stuff. </li>
	<li>Powerfacts - What was monumental architecture for? Proof to the rest of society that elite people were fit to rule it - perhaps they were gods. excessive displays of wealth - powerfacts. </li>
</ul>
<p>Why did stratification begin. People were living in bands. Farming and herding - tribal - not entirely egalitarian. Chiefdom - natufian - chief have elevated status. States - stratified - territories - army - institutions, elite, taxes, specialized craft, writing - 1 state in region, others pop up. 1 state conquering all other states -> Empire. State - monumental architecture, craft specialization, 3 levels or more. Walled towns, lots of weapons. Writing - write about war. Interstate conflict. </p>

<p>Why? Foraging was successful - less work. Long time, thought settle down, social complexity just follows - assumed free time to make their lives more complicated - but lots of village societies never done that and foragers have more free time. Environment - wherever people had need to irrigate, you get increased social complexity because irrigation is lots of work - need to coordinate - not necessarily case - Hohokum - extensive irrigation system, no monuments - remained egalitarien. Sometimes rise of state is exception. Population pressure, someone needs to ensure production is keeping up. Conflict - ample resources - don't need to organize that well. People know how to limit fertility. Maybe once settled, people have to start fighting over it - can't just move away -> rules. Could be internal - cultural/religious movements. Don't know what factors are. NO ANDEAN. Collaborative archaeology - cosmopolitan. 50 MC. Hominins, hominoid. afarensis, afrcanis etc. </p>
