<p><span class="center">What comes to mind when you think of good?</span></p>

<h1>Moral Foundations Theory</h1>

<p>Jonathan Haidt - developed a theory of what are the basic moral foundations. Most influential theory.</p>
<ul>4 Basic Claims (need to be true for theory to make sense): 
	<li><span class="key">Nativism</span> - there's a first draft of the mental mind. In genetic heritage, it's already developing - a preparation. Our human mind is being organized to understand right and wrong. Prepared for adaptive social problems that we need to deal with. Readyness for being able to attend to these things and learn from them.<span class="ex">Readyness to learn language. Language is so complex, but we're able to learn early on. We're not prepared to do a lot of tings, but we're prepared for language and to deal with social problems, so it must be important.</span>Prepared for issues of morality must mean that it's important.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Cultural Learning</span> - first draft is edited in a specific culture. What is actually there can vary - culture, temperament, sensitivity to world, media, parental interactions, etc. Influences. Emphasizing some things more than others<span class="ex">Cultures of honour - in southern US, but not in northern.</span></li>
	<li><span class="key">Intuitionism</span> - intuition comes first, strategic reasoning comes second. Social intuitionist model of morality - we have a gut feeling first then reason. <span class="ex">Consensual activity in a couple, it's safe, they're both happy - they're brother and sister. It goes from nice to euk. Most people say immoral - why is it wrong? Because intuition says it's wrong.</span>Cognitive brain - thinks through justifications of what we're feeling. Justify our feelings, emotioins. Instead of thinking "should I feel this way," well I do. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Pluralism</span> - there isn't just one adaptive problem/challenge, there are a number of recurrent issues/social challenges, so there are many moral foundations.</li>
</ul>

<ul>The "Big Three" of Morality (Schreider, Mark, etc.) - different frameworks
	<li><span class="key">Autonomy</span> - Harm, rights, justice. Western North American framework. Is anybody getting hurt? Is it fair? If so, it's okay. Morality is based on harm, justice, and consent. That determines if it's moral or not.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Community</span> - Duty, hierarchy, interdependency. Group cohesiveness about others. Morality based on accountability to the group.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Divinity</span> - imposed order (sacred or natural), personal sanctity - not defiling yourself/others, suppression of base instincts. This is what's good or bad - this is the way things naturally are in place. Morally based on immutable. Higher/natural order.</li>
</ul>

<ol>Moral Foundations Theory (1-2: Individuating-Autonomy, 3-5: Binding, 3-4: Community, 5: Divinity)
	<li><span class="key">Harm/care</span> (H) - basic concerns for the suffering of others, including virtues of caring and compassion. Want to raise infant until they can take care of themselves. How do we keep this going? Turtle moms lay eggs and leave- perfectly natural. How do we get a parent to not be a turtle parent? Bonding. Breastfeeding, sex - oxytocin. Chemicals. We've got it. Taking care of people.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Fairness/reciprocity</span> (P?) - concerns about unfair treatment, inequality and more abstract notions of justice. Is it fair or not.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Ingroup/loyalty</span> (I) - Concerns related to obligations of group membership, such as loyalty, self-sacrifice, and vigilance against betrayal. Being committed to your ingroup.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Authority/Respect</span> (A) - Concerns related to social order and the obligations of hierarchical relationships such as obedience, respect, and proper role fulfillment. Why want obedience? A child may not listen, go out, and do dumb stuff to get themselves killed. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Purity/Sancitity</span> (P) - Physical and spiritual contagion, including virtues of chastity, wholesomeness, and control of desires. Contamination, pathogens, disgust, "toxic." Symbolic. <span class="ex">Offended by using flag to clean the toilet - desecration s. "it's a really good cloth"<br>Hitler's sweater - would you put on Hitler's sweater? "Ew, no. I'm gonna get Hitler on me!" Hitler-y</span></li>
</ol>
	
<ul>Additional Candidates - If principles are correct, there might be more foundations. It doesn't end with 5. Put out the criteria, and others came up with more. These are the ones that made it. 
	<li><span class="key">Liberty/oppression</span> - freedom</li>
	<li><span class="key">Efficiency/waste</span> - group - are you wasting our resources?</li>
	<li><span class="key">Ownership/theft</span></li>
	<li><span class="key">Industry/Laziness</span> - contributing vs. not</li>
	<li><span class="key">Modest(humility)/superiority</span> - "I'm the best"</li>
	<li><span class="key">Honesty/Deception</span> (or trust betrayal) - trust is ground zero. Determining friend from foe.</li>
</ul>
	
<h1>What is "Good"?</h1>

<p>It's a question of morality, but we're going to look at data.</p>
<p>Approach: understand its opposite - <span class="key">immoral</span></p>

<ul>Two approaches (often conflicting): 
	<li><span class="key">Domain-specific</span> - There are different types of morality. Multiple dimensions/domains. Not one size fits all.<span class="ex">Moral Foundations</span></li>
	<li><span class="key">Domain-general</span> - It's just one thing. One common ingredient. One basic rule. One framework to rule them all.<span class="ex">Dyatic Morality</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="ex">Gray &amp; Kennedy (2016) - Harm/impurity or severe/"weird"? Specific or general? Took some moral scenarios in Moral Foundations research. Harm scenarios and impurity scenarios. Asked: how much harm and how weird? Harm/impurity confounded with severe/weird. Harm scenarios have more severe consequences. Sever scenarios are just weird. Reactions to these scenarios - impure highly positively correlated with harm judgements. Same direction pretty closely. Talking about it distinct, but data ssays they're the same. Argument: Morality is one thing. Confound -> no clear support for moral foundations.</span></p>

<p><span class="key">Dyatic Morality</span> (Gray, Waytz, Young) - Prototypic immoral behaviour is <br>interpersonal harm</br>.</p>
<ul><span class="key">Interpersonal harm</span>: doing X or not will have Y outcome for a moral patient -> will harm some moral patient.
	<li><span class="key">"intentional moral agent"</span> - </li>
	<ul>
		<li>capacity for <span class="key">action</span> (or inaction) - by acting or not acting, I can hurt you.</li>
		<li>capacity for <span class="key">foresight</span> - foresee a certain outcome. Motivation. Intended consequencees. Did you see that coming? Foreseeability.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class="key">"moral patient"</span>
	<ul>
		<li>capacity to experience adverse consequences - capacity to suffer physically or psychologically</li>
		<li>is suffering direct or indirect impact - can happen anywhere on the chain <span class="ex">Environmental - if you harm the environment and it harms someone indirectly</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="key">Dyatic Completion</span> (Gray, Schein, Ward 2014) - if dyatic morality is right, then people will perceive harm happening. If moral judgements are relevant, they will see the harm. If you see an agent, you will see a patient on the other side. Reflex. harm is the default moral judgement.</p>
<p><span class="center">"immoral" -> harm to an immoral patient</span></p>
<ul>Research support: 
	<li><span class="list">impure" scenarios + time pressure -> victims</span> - were there any victims? Time pressure -> more likely to say there were victims (moral patient). Intuition. Strongest under time pressure. An immoral situation -> harm is relevant (default moral situation)</li>
	<li><span class="list">"impure" scenarios (titles) + idiograms (chinese characters)</span> -> idiograms = harm - asked whether or not they thought the idiograms represented harm. Titles with impure scenarios, people were more likely to interpret idograms with harm. Automatic reaction that impurity means harm. </li>
	<li><span class="list">impure as wrong -> higher pain estimates</span> - judged how wrong actions were. Some were accident scenarios. The more impure, the more pain they estimated.</li>
	<li><span class="list">impure or harm scenarios -> children's faces as suffering</span> - impure/harm scenarios caused people to judge children's faces as suffering. Kicks up cognitive associations of harm. Suffering is the default. Harm script. Harm is default. </li>
</ul>

<p>There's harm, but where's the harm? Asked if it was <span class="center">agent (self), patient, or society?</span> People were given lots of time to think and respond - is this really what they think? Problem: retrospective (not automatic). Common response: "I didn't need to see that" by the perceive. </p>
<p>Alternative (never been tested): <span class="center">perceiver (judge) as the victim/patient.</span> Harm is the nastiness. Experiencing themselves as being harmed. Is moral judge the victim by being exposed to this stuff? What they did made me feel this way. Disgust sensitive - more extreme judgements across different domains. Other emotions - same thing. More sensitive - go off and vomit. More reactive -> more intense.</p>

<p class="date">Lecture 2: Jan 11, 2018</p>

<p>Most of Grey's stuff focuses on negative moral judgements - a theory of immoral behaviour, violations that make people react. If we understand immorality, it gives understanding of morality. </p>

<h1>"Quasi-goodness"</h1>
<p><span class="center">typical harm-causing agent (all of us): "I'm good (enough)"</span> Most of us are going ot insist that we're good people or at least that we're good enough. Doing that in the aftermath of intentionally harming someone. And we continue insisting that we're good. But how do we do that? How do we see ourselves as good? </p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<ul>Menu of options: (1-3) focus on I'm good (4) I'm not that good, but I'm no worse than you. (5) I'm bad, that's fine.  
	<li><span class="list">deny action, foresight, or intention</span> - Deny action - I didn't do it. It wasn't me. Denying responsibility. Deny foresight - yeah, I did it. I didn't mean to. It was an accident. Deny that you were an intentional moral agent. I didn't know that would happen. Trying to take away own status. Won't work if security camera.</li>
	<li><span class="list">Deny or minimize the harm inflicted</span> - it wasn't that bad. Walk it off, baby. Denying the impact on the victim. <span class="key">Dementalization</span> - turning moral patient into an object. "Fish can't feel pain." Taking away the pain experience from a potential moral victim - then they're not moral victims anymore. Outgroups - outgroup members are seen as feeling less, having less capacity for suffering. They're not like us. Trying to take away victim's status. <!--"That's kinda shitty, that's the clinical term."-->"Well, you still got one arm." - won't work here.</li>
	<li><span class="list">Justify harm - yes, harm happened</span> - I did it, but there are good reasons why that happened. We develop consciousness to justify our behaviour. "It was for a greater good." Appeal to a higher good. "They deserved it." - this was justice/revenge. They started it. They made me a moral patient. Might not work if it's too nasty.</li>
	<li>OR</li>
	<li><span class="list">Normalize harm</span> - Yes, I did it and you would too if you were in my situation. I'm not perfect, but neither are you. You've done the same thing. I remember when you did something worse, you're a hypocrite. How dare you condemn me?! Turning the whole episode back onto the judge. The message: you have no right to judge me because if you condemn me, you condemn yourself. </li>
	<li><span class="list">Assert one's personal power</span> - haters gonna hate. It doesn't matter. Your judgements can't really hurt me. Nullifies judges power. You can think I'm bad, but this doesn't hurt me. Takes the power away from the judge. </li>
</ul>
	
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Humans have a need to belong. We are a social spieces. We need to be part of a group. That need for belonging got hardwired into us because it makes survival sense - we were able to learn to cooperate and work in groups to hunt and defend ourselves. If you're by yourself, you're screwed. We have a deep-seeded need to feel as though we're part of a group. We don't have to be good, we just have to be good enough. We don't have to be good enough, we just have to be not so bad that we don't get rejected. When people are ostracized, the same parts of the brain light up as with when people experience physical pain. Social rejectionis physically painful. Sets up a powerful motive.</p>
<p><span class="center">intentional harm + "unjustifiable"</span></p>
<p><span class="center">"immoral" ----------> "EVIL"</span></p>
<p><span class="center">"EVIL" = ultimate signifier of social rejection.</span></p>
<p>When we engage in intentional harm. Intentional harm is considered as immoral. If we can't justify that intentional harm? We're not able to make it okay with the group. We call it <span class="key">Evil</span>. Evil is intentional, unjustifiable harm. Evil is the ultimate signifier of social rejection. Once a person os labelled evil, that means you're beyond the group, you're excluded/outside. "The Mark of Cain" - Cain killed his brother - you're gonna lose everything - I'm gonna mark you so no one can kill you - My punishment is greater than I can bear. (bigfoot) You're beyond acceptance. You are targeted for rejection. When we're busted, we go into damage control. We want to get away from this sense of panic, shame, and pain that's associated with social rejection.</p>

<h1>"Real" good</h1>
<p><span class="center">"intentional moral agent"</span></p>
<p><span class="center">"moral patient" with the capacity to experience <b>beneficial</b> consequences</span></p>
<p>Replacing capacity to suffer capacity to benefit. These are morally approved behaviours. Includes <span class="key">mentalizing</span> - you want to enhance the patient's experience. <span class="ex">Findhorn - Scotland - Very green. Backstory - founders had visions and communicated with the nature spirits. Told them what they neeeded to do to plant things. Divas. Attributing the capacity for experience to these plants. </span></p>

<h1>"Greatest" good</h1>
<p><span class="center">"unjustifiable" = no self benefits... only self costs?</span> intentional unjustifiable benefit. Unjustifiable - There's no obvious benefits to the self. No benefits, maybe even be costly to the self. Doing that just cause it benefits the other. </p>
<p>How common, rare or illusory? Does altruistic motivation exist? Cialdini: no. Bats: yes, not common, but it exists. The more extreme the example, the more likely it is that people look at it and say it's something special. Heroes, saints, martyrs. Extreme acts are celebrated. Altruistic love is what is celebrated as being the highest - focus is on benefiting the other. </p>

<p>Recap: try to understand what is good? Got various moral frameworks, perspectives. There are still other pieces. </p>

<h1>Core Virtues</h1>
<p>(Dahlsgaard, Peterson, and Seligman 2005) - framework. philosophical, religious traditions. Tried to identify the core virtues. virtues - people who do good a lot of time. Virtuous - promoting the good. </p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="key">Humanity</span> - interpersonal strength sthat involve tending/befriending others. Love and kindness. The care foundation. (Caring vs. harming) </li>
	<li><span class="key">Justice</span> - Civic strengths that underly healthy community life. Interpersonal. Leadership, citizenship, teamwork. Fairness theme, but in a community context.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Courage</span> - emotional strengths. People somehow display these things (bravery, perseverance). We value these traits. Exercising the will to accomplish goals in the face of opposition. 1. certain level of strong self-regulation. I have the act of the will. I am overpowering the opposition through my own strength of character. I am resisting temptation. I am going beyond my own constraints. </li>
	<li><span class="key">Temperance</span> - strengths that protect against excess. Humility, prudence (being careful), self-control. Another act of the will. Resisting temptation in a different way. Desire to take more than you deserve/need. Gluttony. Not being able to regulate your own intake. Greed. Putting the brakes on yourself.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Wisdom</span> - the acquisition and use of knowledge. Creativity, curiosity, judgement, providing counsel. I have these abilities and I am using them to benefit others.</li>
	<li><span class="key">Transcendence</span> - Strengths that forge connections to the larger universe and provide meaning. Hope, spirituality. Going beyond yourself, going beyond something that's bigger than you. </li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of similar concepts that fit will in the big picture. There doesn't seem to be a 1 to 1 correspondence. Massive world traditions - we can see common themes - themes look at what is good. </p>


<h1>Model of Moral Motives</h1>
<p>(Janoff-Bulman &amp; Carnes (2013)) Another framework. This starts to tie into ideas of how you do good.</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>SELF (personal)</td>
		<td>OTHER (interpersonal)</td>
		<td>GROUP (collective)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Defense/inhibitation/Protect (proscriptive regulation)</td>
		<td>self-restraint/moderation</td>
		<td>not harming</td>
		<td>social order/communal solidarity</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Appetitive/Activation/Provide (prescriptive regulation)</td>
		<td>industriousness</td>
		<td>helping/fairness</td>
		<td>social justice/communal responsibility</td>
	</tr>
</table>
	
<p>There are two motivational directions that are common across all kinds of psychological processes. <span class="key">Amoebic self-theory</span> - comparing human sense of self and amoeba - suggested that there are two goals that all living creatures have - has to protect itself against things that could cause it harm. Two ways to do this - keep things from getting at you or if things got at you, you need to expel them. Sounds like avoidance - defence, inhibition, protection, regulation. It's all about protection. The other thing is to acquire those things that benefit them - acquisitional motivation. Getting, taking, acquiring, moving towards/approaching/obtaining those things that benefit us. Movement towards or away. We respond to them in certain ways. Eat, retreat and excrete (rhyming triplet). How does this fit into moral? These occur at various levels. Level of individual, interpersonal, and group. </p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="list">SELF (personal)</span>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="key">self-restraint/moderation</span> - Moral base - thou shall not. To be a good person, you shouldn't do this. For the inidividual to not harm themselves, they have to self restrain and moderation. Virtue of temperance. Not taking in more than you need, too much. </li>
		<li><span class="key">industriousness</span> - it's what you do, not what you don't do. Conscientiousness. Working hard. Being responsible. Making sure you take care of yourself. Being healthy. Getting exercise. Morally self-benefiting behaviours. They're all about the self (questionable), certainly doesn't hurt the self.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span class="list">OTHER (interpersonal)</span>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="key">not harming</span> - you should not hurt others. You should not be unfair to others, cheat.belittle/ignore. You shouldn't do things that will hurt other people. </li>
		<li><span class="key">helping/fairness</span> - Treating them with respect/dignity. Caring for someone, looking after their needs. Active version of being good. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span class="list">GROUP (collective)</span>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="key">social order/communal solidarity</span> - you should not cause trouble in society. You sshouldn't disrupt the social order. You should stick together, work together. Shouldn't betray people. Shouldn't take more than  your share. Shouldn't do in order for the group to function well. </li>
		<li><span class="key">social justice/communal responsibility</span>. A matter of improving social order. Equality, bettering people.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Moral foundations theory only ties into some of these things. Individualizing - harm, care, fairness are there at the interpersonal level (giant individualizing banner on to of OTHER column). Inidividualizing is capture at the interpersonal level. Could argue that it's not limited at that level. That interpersonal level is being taking care of. Part of the group level is being taking care of by BINDING (binding banner on top of Group + defense) - you're supposed to respect authority, protect the collective, be true to your group. This whole other group level/MF hasn't be addressed. Haidt - suggested that psychologists have ignored conservative thinking. WE're not creating an environment that is inclusive. Liberals only focus on individualizing. Conservatives focus on individualizing and group. Janoff-Bulman said Haidt has missed social justice - liberal ideology are focused on the group but focused in a different way - concerned with equality, not discriminating. Social justice is a group level moral foundation. </p>

<h1>Values and Core Motives</h1>
<p>Schwartz (1992) values theory as a foundation for identify core motives underlying morality.</p>
<p><span class="center">Values: trans-situational goals that vary in importance and serve as guiding principles.</span></p>
<p>He is using the language of goals. Goals implies motivation. He's looking at identifying transituational goals that people are motivated to obtain. The things we want to get at the most. Motives are important. </p>
<p><span class="center">Developed using a bottom-up process</span> Parellels the work done when mapping the human genome. Everybody working together to map this complex thing, once it's done we can really start to move forward. First, sent out a blank page to thousands of people. Asked people: what do you value? A lot of information. Hypothesized correctly that he would see a lot of overlapped. Came from over 30 countries. Not limited to one group. TRied to identify human values. What cuts across cultural groups? What is it that we all share? got it down to 62 values. Make a scale, hand it out to people. Everyone rates it on a scale from 0 to 11. The whole scale doesn't get used most of the time. 30k people. Most people use a small scale (8,9,10). They're values, of course you're going to value them. Question is: which you put at 6-10. </p>
<p><span class="key">Schwartz's Values Circumplex</span>. Methodology: Smallest spaces analysis. See where things cluster. I value honesty, also very likely to say I value being forgiven. If you highly value social power, also wealth, authority, preserving public image. Center point: weighted average of the distances. Critical point: the analysis itself tells you how many dimensions you need to capture the variation in your data. Could've been one dimension (1 line), etc. Ended up being 2D tells us that as human beings, our values can be framed along two dimensions. </p>
<p>First dimension: diagonal. one end: Tradition, devout, moderate, conformity, obedient, elders, self-discipline - package of things, security, belonging, social order, benevolence, loyalty, responsible. The other end: being independent, curious, freedom, daring, exciting life, self-direction, Could have chosen to put this line anywhere. 1 end: conservation, other end: openness to change. When you look at conservation: keeping things safe, stable, non-threatening, familiar, protected. Openness to change: change, alteration, new, excitement, not stable/safe, risky, new things coming in, things you've never experienced before, acquiring. Captures one key set of human beliefs: same theme as Janet-Bulman</p>
<p>Why is it two dimensions and not one? Whatever that dimension is, it's as important to us as appetite and defense. There's something else that matters to us at that level. Other diagonal. 2nd dimension: 1 end (top right): Social power, ambition, self indulgence, success, authority, public image. Other end: inner harmony, social justice, protecting environment, equality, wisdom, openmindedness. People who choose one, will be unlikely to choose the other end. top right: self-enhancement - benefiting the self, other end: self-transendence - benefiting beyond the self. This is actually the dimension of morality. It's a social dimension of dominance vs. equality. Competition vs. cooperation. Fundamentally social. Values don't make sense if we don't put people in the equation. the 2nd set of values is a set of social values - you have poeople who prioritize their own wellbeing, and others prioritizing the wellbeing of what's beyond themselves. They're all good in and of themselves, it's a matter of prioritizing. Self-enhancement: my own needs, wellbeing will come first. Self-transendence- no, the wellbeing of others matters just as much, maybe even more. </p>
<p>This is something that thousands of people have told us. Key: how we relate to others. </p>

<p>Looked online-collected data - moral foundations questionnaire. Lots of people online can fill it out. See if certain consistent clusters emerge. You end up with four groups/patterns that reflect the way in which people respond. The social Structure of Moral Foundations - graph. H - harm. F - fairness. I - ingroup. A - authority. P - purity/sanctity. Peolpe's averages. 4 clustes - labels of what these people look like (demographics). Distinguishing between individualizing vs. binding group. Harm/fairness, binding are the others. 3 of 4 groups, inidividualizing are pripriritized. In the one group, they're all equal. Cluster 1 + 4 - Secular Liberals (not religious) and Social Conservatives. Secular Liberals - is it fair and is anyone getting hurt? Fair, then it's moral. Social Conservatives - all 5 at same level - not prioritizing one framework over the other - some say good - diversifying, some say ehh. Two groups don't get along. Cluster 2 + 3 - Libertarians - harm+fairness are higher than binding, but h/f not a heck of a lot higher than conservatives, binding not a heck of a lot higher than secular - lowest of the low - extreme individualism - self-direction - leave me alone and let me do whatever I want (Tea party). Religous LEft - as high as liberals on individ, as high as conservatives on binding. Individ still a lot higher. Recognize value in all of them, but will prioritize one over the other. </p>
<p>When you look at their value systems. Social Conservatives - conservation end, (moral frameworks run self-trascendence, self-enhancement direction), find people on both sides. Not one kind of moral brand. Secular liberals - on openness to change end, some take universalist/benevolent approach, some are self-service. Religious left - on self-trasendence - across conservation and openness to change - thick morality. Libtertarianism - thin moral framework - on self-direction to self-enhancement. We can map a couple of these things onto each other. </p>

<h1>Putting it all together</h1>

<p><span class="key">self enhancement</span> vs. <span class="key">self-transcendence</span> is the "moral" dimension - to be moral is to prioritize the well-being of that which is beyond the self rather than prioritizing the well-being of the self. To be immoral is to prioritize the well-being of the self at the expense of things beyond the self. This is how we're defining good - it has to do with prioritizing. </p>

<p><span class="center">Many foundations or One foundation to rule them all?</span></p>
<p><span class="center">YES!</span></p>
<ul>Two preliminary theoretical modifications: 
	<li><span class="key">prioritization</span> - The idea of prioritization is distinct from the degree of harm - not: is it designed to feel good or harm, its: which is prioritized? <span class="ex">$20 - distribute. They keep 60%, give you the rest. You're saying it's immoral even though you gained something. They could've given you nothing. It doesn't feel good because they prioritized themselves. It was good, but it wasn't good enough. It's about perception of harm.</span> It's not necessarily harm, it's just a relative harm.</li>
	<li><span class="key">potential</span> - rather than talking about harm or benefit, it's useful/a<span class="center">urate to talk about the <span class="key">potential</span> for harm/benefit. Threat vs. opportunity. <span class="ex">Imagine driving home at night. I'm gonna drive home on the wrong side of the road. If you su</span>eed, nobody got hurt. Nothing happened. It's all good. Was your action moral? No, because you increased the risk that other people would be harmed, injured, killed. Unnecessarily putting somebody at risk is immoral. </span> The idea of potential of risk. </li>
</ul>
<p>Different levels of analysis - example in another field. Emotional theorists have argued that we experience emotions as a way to alert us to changes in the environment. We feel different things - fear -> threatening, disgust -> expulsion, joy. Despite all of these emotions, they are basically all focused on two goals: either designed to protect you to avoid danger, or to benefit you in terms of acquisitions and satiating your appetite. They're working together. We have many emotions organized with two basic motives. Physics vs. Chemistry - one looks at the building blocks (how do they fit together and work together). It's not either or. </p>
<p>Moral foundations emerge as a response to distinct evolutionary challenges. Challenges can be varied - taking care of infants, fairness + reciprocity, etc. Challenges are there and we have different moral foundations. But they are all organized over the same two fundamental goals: is this harming or is this benefiting? When it gets crossed with our social nature, it becomes morals. Morality only exists in the social world. We're responding to the environment by these environmental threats. Big picture: harm + benefits, all focused on prioritizing yourself or somebody else? Who do we put first, rest is what is our goal? </p>

<h1>Why is "good"?</h1>
<!--"let the record show it's why, which is what i'm asking to myself as we speak." -->
<p>What can <span class="key">Empathy</span> mean? It gets a lot of different meanings attached to it. </p>

<ul>At least 3 distinct uses (people have to be more precise now): 
	<li><span class="key">Emotional contagion</span> (or sharing) - "feeling <b>as</b>" Feeling what another feels. 
	<ul>
		<li><span class="list">most basic</span> - non-human spieces can do it, young infants can do it. fairly automatic process. neurological level - same areas light up in perceiver and target, the brains are doing the same things.</li>
		<li><span class="list">often not prosocial</span> - if emotional contagion involves sharing of negative emotions, that doesn't feel good. then the focus of attention is trying to make yourself feel better. If the only way to make yourself feel better, ok then I'll do it, but you could escape or intervene.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span class="key">Perspective-taking</span> - imagining. Cognitive empathy. Not feeling the same thing, not necessarily even feeling anything. Trying to get inside their head and trying to imagine what they feel. Imagining what the other is thinking, feeling, wanting, etc. Very cognitive. Not necessarily driven by emotion or resulting in emotion. 
	<ul>
		<li><span class="list">other as moral patient</span> - they have the capacity for experience. Unless there is a mind to get into, perspective taking isn't meaningful. </li>
		<li><span class="list">Effortful</span>. It takes work to understand what the world looks like with another perspective. </li>
		<li><span class="list">Not always accurate</span>. </li>
		<li><span class="list">Sometimes prosocial</span> - Just because I don't care, doesn't mean I don't understand." - depending on the perceivers goals, perspective taking can jumpstart prosocial behaviour or I know exactly what your weaknesses are - I can make your life effin' miserable. The same PT ability can have prosocial behaviour or antisocial behaviour. If you really get their vulnerabilities, you can address them and make them better or make them worse. Sadists engage in PT.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span class="key">Empathic concern</span> - "feeling <b>for</b>" - sympathy, compassion. You do not have to experience their emotion, you feel for them for feeling that emotion
	<ul>
		<li><span class="list">self &amp; other distinct</span> - you sometimes lose the distinction between the self and other. You're terrified, I'm terrified, I'm focused on my terrified. Concern: you're not feeling as, you're feeling for. The self and other are seen as distinct. Not necessarily feeling as they are feeling. </li>
		<li><span class="list">Often prosocial*</span> - limits. </li>
		<li><span class="list">Can fuel altruistic motivation</span> - If you think altruistic motivation exists, then empathic concern is the engine behind altruistic motivation - prosocial behaviour is toward benefiting the other as an end in itself. Not for yourself, but because you want to help the other. <span class="ex">Manipulated with escape - it's difficult escape or easy escape. Personal distress - if people have an easy escape, they'll tkae it. They'll only reduce their distress if they can't get out of there. It may be prosocial, but your goal is so you won't feel like crap anymore. Empathic concern predicts the same amount of helping regardless of ease of escape. "You're really concerned with this person's welfare" - you could weasel out, but you're hanging in there. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>Is "empathy" automatic or controllable?</h2>
<p>"Yes" (Zaki, 2014)</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="list">Evidence of automaticity</span>: mimicry, neural resonance - there's a natural kind of mimicry that happens - we adopt similar postures, facial expressions (even video clip). Neurological level - similar areas of the brain light up. Even when people are not instructed to engage in mimicry, even when under cognitive load. Lots of evidence that suggests that to some degree, it's automatic. </li>
	<li><span class="list">Evidence of controllability</span>: ingroup/outgroup, doctor/patient. Show that if you observe an individual in pain or discomfort, but they're an outgroup member. You don't get the automatic neural activity that's emotional contagion. People can shut it down. Doctors that have to perform uncomfortable procedures - they can shut it down beforehand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, we see both of those pieces going on. </p>

<h2>How do people regulate "empathy"?</h2>
<p>PT is effortful, so that's controllable. How do people regulate the automatic stuff? </p>
<ul>3 things they can do: 
	<li><span class="key">situation selection</span> - people can engage in situation selection. They're gonna go there or not even. "Why'd you watch a sad movie?" "I just needed a good cry" People seek it out where they can empathize with the characters. They're selecting that situation. Alternatively, if we see someone panhandling and we know if we walk past we're gonna get hit up, we cross the street M-mm, not gonna go there - sidesteeping the situation - avoiding it. </li>
	<li><span class="key">attention modulation</span> - you can't always be proactive, can't always avoid situations. What do you do once you're in there? There's a lot going on, you can pay more attention to some things than other things. If you don't want empathy spoiling your day, you can get rid of empathy by not focusing on the other person's emotions. Amp up PT, or try to remain detached - focus on anything but what the person's feeling.</li>
	<li><span class="key">appraisal</span> - trying to make sense out of the target's reactions. What's the person really feeling? How much are they really feeling? Why do they feel this way? They may be suffering, but it may be because they are dumbshits. Why should I empathize with someone woh's stupid. What impact should this person's reaction have on me? Depending on our appraisal, yep I'm gonna go there or nope, you forfeited that note cause you're an idiot. </li>
</ul>
