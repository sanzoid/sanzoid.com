Scott's Tots

[Aug 2017] HEY MR. SCOTT, WHATCHU GON' DO? WHATCHU GON' DO? MAKE OUR DREAMS COME TRUE!<br>After a successful first spray paint shirt, did this one. I wanted to get it darker faster, but ended up spraying too close causing it to bleed. Also, the stencil was not cut very well so the edges of the letters aren't crisp. 

No Culture

[Aug 2017] First non-bleach shirt. Bought some Tulip Color Shot spray paint. Turned out looking pretty great except I didn't tape down the newspaper on the edges. (Mother Mother)

Martian Manhunter

[Aug 2017] J'onn J'onzz. I had cut it out a long time ago and when it finally came to bleaching it, I kind of rushed it. A huge cloud blocked the sun and I had to wait for it to pass. It took a long time to get the body to be so light and then I didn't spend the same amount of time for the cape and text. I also accidentally left a paper towel drenched in bleach on the collar...

[Dec 2016] Made this when I was only on episode 3.

Purge Front

[Jul 2016] Saw The Purge: Election Year the day before it officially came out. First time at the movies all by myself. I loved it so I decided to spend all of Canada Day (the next day) making this! 

Purge Back

Purge Sleeve

[Jul 2016] On the left sleeve like a sticker. 

Mose

[Apr 2016] Mose is my favourite minor minor character on The Office. Of course I'd make a shirt with him on it! This is one of my favourite results. The brown shirt resulted in a nice yellow poo colour. 

Kauai

[Apr 2016] My friend is a big fan of Childish Gambino. Originally promised her a friendship bracelet with Kauai colours on it, but I'm so slow at making those. This was also my first experiment dealing with different layers. Turned out pretty awesome. Unfortunately, I had nothing planned for the back so it's just black. 

Hogwarts

[Apr 2016] One of the first designs I saw. Showed my friend and she wanted one, and so I made it. Very easy to do! 

The Blacklist

[Apr 2016] This one was the first one where I decide to bleach the negative space, so the back is bleached as well. I've been told it looks like mold on the back. 

Totoro

[Apr 2016] I've seen this design a couple of times on different t-shirt sites. I love designs where it's like you ARE the character. Gave this one to my mom. 

Star Laboratories

[Apr 2016] Grant Gustin looks so good in one of those Star Labs navy sweaters! Had to make one of my own. I forgot to cut out the square in the middle of the logo, so I tried to fix it the day after. Actually made it worse.

Pied Piper

[Apr 2016] This first in my batch after getting a new spray bottle and shelf liner. I sprayed way too close and the bleach just bled everywhere. 

House

[Apr 2016] Cardstock again. I thought this was 100% cotton, but it wasn't. 60/40 cotton/poly. It took so many layers to get it to be so light. I originally stopped when it was brown, then decided to do it again the next day. I also went over unwanted bleached spots with a black Sharpie. 

Daredevil

[Apr 2016] Very proud of this one. I decided to use cardstock for this one. Although a bit of bleach did seep through the cardstock, it turned out pretty awesome. Possibly because it was a towel, it needed a lot of bleach in order for you to really notice a difference. I really love Charlie Cox and the black mask costume. 

S.H.I.E.L.D.

[Apr 2016] My very first bleached shirt. When I found out this was a thing, I immediately got right on it. I have ~5 of these shirts so decided to spice one of them up. I've always wanted an Agents of SHIELD logo shirt. I used a pizza box for the stencil, emptied a Febreze spray bottle, and clearly didn't know what I was doing.
